<i>THERE is expressed from the grapes
that ripen on the sunny slopes
of Aÿ a wine called</i> Fine Fleur
d’Aÿ blanc—<i>Fine Flower of
white Aÿ—a sparkling, golden, perfumed
nectar, to sip of which is an exhilaration.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><i>In every ideal home there exists an essence
that likewise diffuses its fragrance—the
fine flower of noble womanhood, without
which the house is a habitation, not a
home.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><i>Alone under the ministering care of
woman may the routine of daily life be relieved
and varied, and the course of the
household made to flow free from friction
and asperity. Caressed by her gentle touch,
order ranges itself, beauty finds a dwelling-place,
and peace enters as an abiding guest.
Pre-eminently it is woman that idealizes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the home, and, with her sweet, refining
presence, mingled with the joyous laugh of
children, creates its atmosphere of serenity
and content.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><i>To the gentler sex, therefore—to the old
and to the young, to the dark and to the
fair, to all who woo for us the sunshine of
the home—a health in the Fine Flower of
Aÿ!</i></p>

A SHADED slope bounds the homestead
to the southward, and a
thick copse, descending rather
abruptly to the river, flanks the
grounds in the rear. Screened
from sun and glare, the grass-plot is always
a favorite lounging-place during hot weather.
Across the water a west or south wind
invariably blows, freighted with coolness
and charged with that indefinable odor
which the wind gathers from its passage
through a wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the trees and bushes and grasses
along the river banks the air has dusted a
fragrance; from the leaves, the fern fronds,
and the flowers it has extracted an aroma.
The scent of the swamp honeysuckle
along the hillside now forms its strongest
component part. Its perfume is tangible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>fresh, and uncloying—sentient with the delicious
breath of the summer—and, I fancy,
charms the wood-thrushes into sweeter song.</p>

<p class='c001'>The west or south wind invariably blows.
Even when not felt, it may be seen in the aspen’s
trembling leaves; so that, however hot
the day, here a breeze may be always felt or
seen. Through the trees the river sparkles,
and through a wider opening may be traced
its sinuous course until it merges into haze
and sky. My book remains unopened; it is
pleasanter to read the earth and air. The bees
hum, a wood-dove calls, the soothing roar
of the rapids rises and falls. So sweet is
summer air, so caressing are summer sounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>How the sails have multiplied on the
river! Is it the haze or the sudden sunlight
that has transformed their canvas into unaccustomed
color? Yonder a larger vessel,
of different mold from the pleasure-craft, is
rounding the river’s curve in her cruise up-stream.
Her clean-cut prow rises high in
air, her painted canvas is spread, and the
sunlight strikes the gold of her sides. Onward
she sails, graceful as a water-bird,
tacking at intervals to catch the breeze. At
once it becomes plain to me—it is no mirage,
no cheat of the atmosphere, but a reality.
Up the river from the lake, through
the lake from the sea; launched from her
harbor in distant lands, and laden with her
precious stores, my ship has come!</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>I.<br /> <br />THE PERFECT HOUSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>People who know my house come to like it a little;
people who merely glance at it see nothing to call for
comment, and so pass on....</p>

<p class='c019'>My house not being a fine house, nor a costly house,
nor what people call an elegant house, what is there in
it to describe?—<span class='sc'>O. B. Bunce, My House.</span></p>
<div class='c000'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-i1.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
I MAKE no claim that the house
wherein I dwell is a perfect
one; it is my first house—a
fledgling. One must build at
least thrice, it has been truly
observed, to obtain the perfected dwelling,
and still there will remain room for improvement.
So many things go to make
up the ideal house, it is beyond human possibility
to combine them all; while even
during the process of construction one’s
tastes are liable to change or become subject
to modification.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the most of mankind a single venture
is sufficient; only architects build more than
once for a pastime. For the sole office of
the architect is to plan; the province of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the builder to delay. The asylums teem
with victims to the vexations of house-building.
Having money to make and not
to disburse, with no further care than to
complete the work in hand with the utmost
leisure, the architect and builder pass
through the ordeal unscathed, and remain
to lure new victims. One exception I recall.
Picturesquely situated on the eastern
coast, within hearing of the surge and rising
amid the forest-growth, stands an untenanted
villa. The imposing exterior is
of massive stone, and all that unlimited
wealth and taste could contribute has been
lavished upon the interior. The mansion
was completed within the specified time,
but during its construction architect and
builder both died, the owner living only
three days after its completion. From the
placing of the foundation-stone to the prospective
fire in the hearth—from commencement
to completion—who may foresee the
possibilities? Ever man proposes while
Fate disposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plans look so feasible on paper, and
building seems so delightfully facile in
theory—so much time, so much money,
and your long-dreamed-of castle in Spain
is a reality. But, like the quest of a German
professor I once knew who was
searching for a wife who must be rich,
beautiful, young, angelic, and not afraid of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>a mouse, the perfect house is difficult to attain;
while plans often resemble the summer
excursions one takes with the mind
during winter, apparently so easy to carry
out and yet so unfrequently realized. We
forget the toilsome climb up the mountain
where we arrive, perchance, to find the
view shrouded in mist; or a cold spell sets
in when we reach the seashore; or heavy
rains render the long-contemplated angling
trip a dismal failure.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we leave the house to the architect,
he builds merely for himself—he builds <i>his</i>
house, not yours. You must be the idealist
of your own ideal. “Our so-called
architects,” says Richard Jefferies, “are
mere surveyors, engineers, educated bricklayers,
men of hard, straight ruler and
square, mathematically accurate, and utterly
devoid of feeling. You call in your practical
architect, and he builds you a brick
box. The princes of Italy knew better;
they called in the poet and the painter, the
dreamers, to dream for them.” How the
penetrating insight of Montaigne pierced
the mask of the architect: “The Merchant
thrives not but by the licentiousness of
youth; the Husbandman but by dearth of
corne; the Architect but by the ruine of
houses!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty
is to secure a house already constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>that will meet your requirements as
nearly as may be. But the mere building,
the foundation, construction, architectural
details, and interior arrangement are only a
small part of numerous vital factors that
should enter into the question of the house
and home. There are equally the considerations
of situation, neighborhood, accessibility,
and a score of like important features
to be seriously meditated on. One
can not afford to make mistakes in building
or in marrying. “In early manhood,”
says Cato, “the master of a family must
study to plant his ground. As for building,
he must think a long time about it.”
The external construction is, indeed, the
least part of building—there is still the
decorating and the furnishing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wise is he who weighs and ponders
ere he decides upon the location of his
house, especially if he would be near the
town. For in the ideal home I would unite
many things, including pure air, sufficient
elevation, pleasant views, the most suitable
exposure, good soil, freedom from noise,
and the natural protection from wind afforded
by trees. “Let our dwelling be
lightsome, if possible; in a free air and
near a garden,” is the advice of the philosopher,
Pierre du Moulin. Very apposite are
old Thomas Fuller’s directions for a site—“<i>Chiefly
choose a wholesome air</i>, for air is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>dish one feeds on every minute, and therefore
it need be good.” And again: “Light
(God’s eldest daughter) is a principal beauty
in a building, and a pleasant prospect is to
be respected.” In the chapter of the Essays,
on Smells and Odors, the author pertinently
observes: “The principall care I
take, wheresoever I am lodged, is to avoid
and be far from all manner of filthy, foggy,
ill-savouring, and unwholesome aires.
These goodly Cities of strangely seated
Venice and huge-built Paris, by reason of
the muddy, sharp, and offending savours
which they yield; the one by her fennie
and marish situation, the other by her durtie
uncleannesse and continuall mire, doe
greatly alter and diminish the favor which
I bear them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All these desiderata are well-nigh impossible
to unite in the city. There all
manner of nuisances necessarily exist—manufactories
which discharge noxious
smoke and soot, the clangor of bells and
whistles, an atmosphere more or less
charged with unwholesome exhalations.
This more particularly in summer; in winter
I grant the city has its charms and advantages.
Wealth may sometimes combine
the delights of urban and rural life, as
when a large residence plot is retained in
a pleasant neighborhood of the town. But
even unlimited means can rarely procure a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>place of this description, which comes by
inheritance rather than by choosing, and in
the end becomes too valuable to retain.
Besides, however fine the ancestral trees
and endeared the homestead, it must still
lack the repose of the country, the free expanse
of sky, the unfettered breadth of the
fields.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I look about me I find the combination
I would attain a difficult one to
secure in almost any city. If I build in the
suburbs, upon the most fashionable avenue,
its approaches may be disagreeable
and the surrounding landscape flat and uninviting.
The opposite quarter of the suburbs,
the main northern residence avenue,
will be windy during winter. If I locate
westward there may be factories and car-shops
to constantly offend the ear; if I
move eastward unsavory odors may assail,
and if I select a site in yet another neighborhood
that commends itself for its elevation
and pleasant society, there may be the
smoke and soot of neighboring chimneys
to defile the air and intrude themselves
unceasingly into my dwelling. The country-seat
sufficiently removed from town,
and yet comparatively accessible, alone
may yield, during the greater portion of
the year, all the desired qualifications of
the ideal home. Does not Béranger truly
sing—</p>

<p class='c021'>And have not all the poets before him apostrophized
the delights of a country life?</p>
<p class='c001'>Why not the town-house, and also the
country-seat—a hibernaculum for the winter,
and a <i>villeggiatura</i> for the summer?
Unfortunately, this would involve constructing
two houses, meeting a double building
liability, harboring two sets of worries;
and, moreover, one’s library, however
modest, can not well be disarranged or
periodically shifted from one place to another.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old Latins were distinguished as
we well know for their love of the country.
Virgil, Ovid, Tibullus, and Terence all had
their country-seats. Horace, in addition to
the Sabine farm, possessed his cottage at
Tivoli, and longed for a third resort at Sorrento.
Pliny the Younger, and Cicero rode
seventeen miles from Rome to Tusculum
daily to gain repose. Pliny’s letters attest
his intense fondness for rural surroundings.
The holder of numerous country-houses,
he has described two of them very minutely,
his descriptions giving to posterity the
most reliable and truthful account of the
old Roman villas. Of all his villas, including
those at Tusculum, Præneste, Tibur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>several on Lake Como, and his Laurentine
and Tuscan resorts, the two latter were his
especial favorites, whose fascinations he
never tires of recounting. Especially attractive
is his account of Laurentium: the
apartments so planned as to command the
most pleasing views; the dining-room
built out into the sea, ever washed by the
advancing wave; the terrace before the
gallery redolent with the scent of violets;
the gallery itself so placed that the shadow
of the building was thrown on the terrace
in the forenoon; and at the end of the gallery
“the little garden apartment” looking
on one side to the terrace, on the other to
the sea; his elaborate bath-rooms and
dressing-rooms, his tennis-court and tower,
and his own sleeping-room carefully constructed
for the exclusion of noise. “My
house is for use, and not for show,” he exclaims;
“I retire to it for a little quiet
reading and writing, and for the bodily
rest which freshens the mind.” One side
of the spacious sitting-room invited the
morning, the other the afternoon sun. One
room focused the sunlight the entire day.
In the walls of this his study was “a
book-case for such works as can never be
read too often.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Tuscan villa was on a still more
extensive scale, the house facing the south,
and adorned with a broad, long colonnade,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in front of which reposed a terrace embellished
with numerous figures and bounded
with a hedge of box from whence one descended
to the lawn inclosed with evergreens
shaped into a variety of forms.
This, in turn, he states, was fenced in by a
box-covered wall rising by step-like ranges
to the top, beyond which extended the
green meads, fields, and thickets of the Tuscan
plain, tempered on the calmest days by
the breeze from the neighboring Apennines.
The dining-room on one extremity of the
terrace commanded the magnificent prospect,
and almost cooled the Falernian.
There, too, are luxurious summer and winter
rooms, a tennis-court, a hippodrome
for horse exercise, shaded marble alcoves
in the gardens, and the play of fountain
and ripple of running water. The long
epistle to Domitius Apollinaris, descriptive
of the Tuscan retreat, he concludes by saying:
“You will hardly think it a trouble to
read the description of a place which I am
persuaded would charm you were you to
see it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the delightful situation and the
well cared for gardens of Pliny’s country-seats,
it will be seen, no less than the refined
elegance and the conveniences of the
splendid houses themselves, of which Pliny
was mainly his own architect, that rendered
them so attractive. Assuredly he must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>have been a most accomplished house-builder
and artist-architect; for, in addition
to the many practical and artistic features
he has enumerated with such precision, he
specifies a room so contrived that when he
was in it he seemed to be at a distance
from his own house. But even Pliny’s
wealth and inventive resources, much as
they contributed to his comfort, could not
combine everything. He could not bring
Laurentium to him; he must needs go to
her. The daily ride of seventeen miles and
back to the city must have been irksome
during bad weather; and even amid all his
luxury and beauty of scenery he bewails
the lack of running water at Laurentium.
Luxurious and convenient as were the old
Roman villas, they were built with only
one story, in which respect at least the
modern house is an improvement upon
the house of the ancients; and there yet
remain other beautiful sites than those
along the Tyrrhenian sea or in the vale of
Ustica.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether the house be situated in the
country or in the town, whether it be large
or small, it is apparent that the site and the
exposure are of primary importance. So
far as situation is concerned, a rise of ground
and an easterly exposure, with the living-rooms
on the south side, is undoubtedly
the pleasantest. During the summer the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>prevailing west wind blows the dust of the
street in the opposite direction; during
winter the living-rooms are open to the
light and sun. The comfort of the house
during summer, and the outer prospect
from within during winter, will depend in
no small degree upon the proper planting
of the grounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Deciduous trees, and here the variety is
great, will shade and cool it in summer,
evergreens will furnish and warm its surroundings
in winter; while for a great
portion of the year the hardy flower-garden,
including the shrubberies that screen
the grounds from the highway, and the
climbers which disburse their bloom and
fragrance over its verandas and porches,
will contribute largely to its beauty and
attractiveness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Somehow I can not look upon my
house by itself, without including as accessories,
nay, as essential parts of it, its outward
surroundings and external Nature—the
woods whence its joists and rafters
were hewed, the earth that supplied its mortar,
brick, and stone, the coal whence it derives
its light and heat, the trees that ward
off the wind in winter and shield it from the
sun in summer, the garden which contributes
its flowers, the orchards and vineyards
that supply its fruits, the teeming fields and
pastures that continuously yield the largess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of their corn, and flocks, and herds. From
each of these my house and I receive a
tithe.</p>

<p class='c001'>My purpose, however, even were I able
to do the subject justice, is not to treat of
the adornment of gardens, of architectural
styles, expression of purpose in building,
or the proper exterior form for the American
town-house and country villa. There
remain, nevertheless, some features of the
interior of the home to which I would fain
call attention, though even here, more than
in the matter of the exterior, opinions necessarily
differ. Every house, methinks,
should possess its distinctive character, its
individual sentiment or expression; and
this depends less upon the architect and
the professional decorator than upon the
taste reflected by the occupants. And yet
there is nothing so bizarre or atrocious
that it will not please some; there exists
nothing so perfect as to please all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shall the ideal house be large or small?
Excellent results may follow in either case
in intelligent, thoughtful hands. Where
money is merely a secondary object, then
the great luxuriously furnished rooms, the
lofty ceilings, the grand halls and staircases,
the picture gallery, the music, billiard,
and ball rooms, the house of magnificent
distances and perspectives. Still
man is not content; for such a house, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>be beautiful, calls for constant care, a retinue
of servants, a blaze of light, a round of
visitors and entertainments to populate its
vast apartments and render it companionable.
The house to entertain in and the
house to live in are generally two separate
things; but, of the two, you want to
live in your house more than to entertain
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Doubtless, even to those possessed of
abundant means, the medium-sized house,
sufficiently roomy for all ordinary purposes
and yet cosy enough for family comfort, is
the most satisfactory. In daily domestic
life you do not become lost and absorbed
in its magnitude; and for the matter of
entertainments, on a large scale, you always
have the resource of a “hall,” with no
further trouble beyond that of issuing the
invitations and liquidating the bills. In
the ideal dwelling-house of medium size
even this will be dispensed with, while
still preserving the charm of privacy—one
has simply to add a supplementary supper-room
and an ample ball-room, to be thrown
open only on special occasions for the accommodation
of the overflow. Thus it
would be possible to avoid a barn to live
in, and a cote to entertain in.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great thing in house planning is to
think ahead, and still think ahead. The
hall which looks so spacious on paper is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>sure to contract, and ordinary-sized rooms
will shrink perceptibly when they come to
be furnished. It is important that the
spaces between the doors and windows,
the proportionate height of the doors and
windows, the many little conveniences,
and innumerable minor yet major details,
like the placing of mantels, registers, chandeliers
and side-lights, be planned by the
occupant, and not left to the mercy of
the architect. The latter will place the
mantel on the side of a long, narrow room,
thereby diminishing the width several feet,
when it should go at the end. He will
hang the doors so they will bump together,
or open on the side you do not want them
to open on. If he concede you a spacious
hall and library, he will clip on the vestibule,
or be a miser when he doles out the space
for the stairway landing or the butler’s
pantry. And what architect will stop to
think of that most important of household
institutions—a roomy, convenient, concealed
catch-all, or rather a series of catch-alls!</p>

<p class='c001'>Even so simple a contrivance as an invisible
small wardrobe in the wall adjoining
the entrance—a receptacle for hats,
wraps, and waterproofs—he has never yet
devised. Every hall must of necessity be
littered up with that hideous contrivance,
a hat-rack, in a more or less offensive form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>when at a touch a panel in the wainscot
might fly open to joyfully engulf the outer
vesture of visitors. You must see your
house planned and furnished with the inward
eye ere the foundation is laid, and
exercise the clairvoyant’s art if you would
not be disappointed when it is finally ready
for habitation. The question of closet-room
is best left to the mistress of the
house, otherwise it is certain to be stinted;
and it were economy in the end to secure
the services of a competent <i>chef</i> to plan the
kitchen and its accessories—that tributary
of the home through whose savory or unsavory
channels so great a wave of human
enjoyment or dolor flows.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with houses very much as it is with
gardens—no two are ever precisely alike;
so far at least as the interior of the former
is concerned. Both reflect, or should reflect,
through a hundred different ways and
niceties of adjustment and arrangement, the
individual tastes of those who are instrumental
in their creation. The ideal house
must first be conceived by those who are
to dwell in it, modeled according to their
requirements, mirroring their ideas, their
refinement, and their conceptions of the
useful and the beautiful. By different persons
these ends are approached by different
ways. So long as we attain the desired
end, the route thereto is of little consequence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>But in the ideal house, it may be
observed, a little money and a good deal of
taste go a very great way.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the eyes of Argus and all the clubs
of Hercules must need be yours, would you
see your house perfectly planned and perfectly
constructed. The terrible gauntlet one
has to run! He who builds should have
nothing to divert his mind from the task. It
is the work of a lifetime crowded into a
year.</p>

<p class='c001'>And when all is done, and the lights
are turned on and the house is peopled
with its guests, who is there that is fully
content with the result of his labor? who
that finds in the fruition the full promise of
the bloom? The perfect house in itself exists
no more than the perfect man or woman.
We can at best set up an exalted
standard of excellence to approximate as
nearly as we may. It is very much in
building as it is in life, where content with
what we have is, after all, the true source
of happiness. “I long ago lost a hound,
a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am
still on their trail,” is the burden of Walden.
How many of us are not likewise in
quest of the something that ever eludes?
When we think we have come up with
the fox, it is but his shadow we seize; he
himself has already vanished round the ravine.
We follow, but may not overtake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>at will, the siren that the poet beckoned for
in vain:</p>

<p class='c001'>What philosopher among all who have
moralized and analyzed has discovered the
sought-for stone? Amiel failed in the pursuit:
“I am always waiting for the woman
and the work which shall be capable of
taking entire possession of my soul, and of
becoming my end and aim.” “A man’s happiness,”
says Alphonse Karr, in an apothegm
worthy of La Bruyère, “consists in that
which he has not got, or that which he no
longer has.” The coveted bauble palls
when it is finally ours, the “dove” escapes,
and we all grow old. Absolute happiness
flees when we enter our ’teens. Methinks
the French poet Chénier has resolved
the experience of most of us with reference
to a certain phase of life as felicitously as
any of those who have endured and felt:</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet, I like to think, and cherish the thought,
when the cloud reveals no silver lining, that
however disappointing some phases of life
may be, some experiences of human character,
there are bright days and pleasant
places ahead in the future, somewhere and
sometime. Happiness is coy at the best,
fickle in bestowing her favors; and we find
her the more delightful, possibly, in that, like
the sunshine, she comes and goes. We
awaken some morning to find her present,
and the next morning she has flown. “It
sometimes seemeth that when we least
think on her she is pleased to sport with
us.” So many she has to minister to that
she has necessarily but a brief period to
remain. Still I see her ever laughing with
the children at play, and find her lingering
where industry abides. Beside the humble
board of the laborer she is often found,
while frequently passing by the homes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the rich. Over gardens and fields she hovers
on pleasant days of spring, and on
blustering winter nights I hear the rustle of
her wings above the poet’s page. The
sunshine that sifts through the window,
warming and gilding all my surroundings,
is mine to-day; to-morrow it may
stream elsewhere. It is all the brighter
when it comes; but to possess it I must
open wide the casement to let in the
beams.</p>
<p class='c001'>Climbing with the sunny Rector of Eversley
to the lonely tarn amid the hills—you
have read and admired Chalk-Stream Studies;
or, if not, you have that enjoyment in
store—I recall the moral that adorns this
delightful essay. “What matter,” he happily
reasons, “if, after two hours of such
enjoyment, he (the angler) goes down
again into the world of man with empty
creel or with a dozen pounders or two-pounders,
shorter, gamer, and redder-fleshed
than ever came out of Thames or
Kennet? What matter? If he has not
caught them, he might have caught them;
he has been catching them in imagination
all the way up; and if he be a minute philosopher,
he holds that there is no falser
proverb than that devil’s beatitude, ‘Blessèd
is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall
not be disappointed.’ Say, rather: ‘Blessèd
is he who expecteth everything, for he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>enjoys everything once, at least; and, if it
falls out true, twice also.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>And with this gentle spirit, despite his
many trials, Charles Kingsley lived on
through life, shedding sunshine and cheer
from the vine-embowered rectory at Eversley.
His house was large enough for his
personal comforts, for the entertainment
of his chosen friends, and for the satisfaction
of his domestic requirements; and this
sufficed. Reflecting the “sweetness and
light” of his own nature, it became the
perfect house to him for the reason that he
was satisfied with his surroundings. The
ideal home is largely the handiwork of the
contented mind; and if before we build
we learn to extract the finer essences of
things, we may then pluck the rose where
others only find the thorn.</p>

THE floors of my house, where
hard-wood floors exist, are
shellacked. This imparts an excellent
finish without darkening
the wood, and the subsequent
care of the floor is slight. Beneath the
rugs the finish is sand-papered to prevent
them from sliding. Oiling floors is objectionable,
the wood turning dark, and necessitating
almost daily going over with a
damp and a dry cloth to keep them clean.
Waxing is a labor, and renders the floors
slippery. Varnishing makes a very smooth
surface, easily marred, the gloss soon
wearing in the least exposed places.</p>

<p class='c001'>My floors must, first of all, be subservient
and subordinate to my rugs. By shifting
my rugs I immediately change the color
of a room, the expression of my house; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>may cool a room in summer or warm it in
winter at will. Beautiful as beautiful paintings
are some of the antique Persian and
Conia prayers, and the marvelously wrought
Yourdes and ancient Coulas. I believe there
is no comprehensive book on rugs. Some
enterprising publisher should send a capable
artist to Asia for a year and publish an
exhaustive <i>édition de luxe</i> to supply a long-felt
want. An artistic work of this nature
would be as desirable as an edition of King
Solomon’s lost book on gems. For color
and color-blending we must go to the Orientals;
they have found its soul. Who else
could blend greens and blues so felicitously,
or place the different reds in riotous juxtaposition,
or combine the whole gamut of
browns with the entire octave of yellows?
They play with colors as a musician plays
with the keys of an instrument. They sound
no false notes, they strike no discords. I
speak of the art as exhibited by the best
masters. There are plenty of daubs and
crudities, it is true, a single specimen of
which will throw a whole house into an entasia.
There is poor sculpture and there are
poor paintings. The finer examples of the
loom deserve to be stamped with the artist’s
name just as much as a canvas of Gérôme
or a love-song of Hafiz.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be nothing more artistic, there
is nothing more seductive than these old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Asiatic hand-paintings. I am drawn and
fascinated by their weird beauty. What
charms do they not reveal! what multiplicity
yet harmony of hue and design!
Though not unfrequently repeating themselves
in the same piece, color and design
never tire. They have their recurrent beat
and rhythm, like the harmonious cadence of
the Pantoum. This large Afghan rug, for
instance, mellow with use and time, the
general tone of which resembles that of a
zircon, is composed of innumerable shades
of red, so many shades I can scarcely count
them, one shade melting into another shade—shades
of shades—till the eye renounces
the task of pursuit. When examined closely,
I find even magenta has been employed
by the craftsman, to become in his hands
a medium of beauty. A European produces
a stiff-set pattern, the Oriental a maze
of which one never tires. There is always
an unsuspected figure or color to reveal itself,
an oddity to suddenly appear, new
lights and new shadows.</p>

<p class='c001'>In coloring, some of the Afghans touch
closely upon the Bokharas, though the
former are less closely woven, but are generally
less set, and more pleasing in design.
As a class, I think the Bokharas are overestimated,
their usual lack of borders or indistinct
bordering giving them an unfinished
look, despite their fineness of texture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and the gloss of their terra-cotta shades.
My large thick blue Bokhara, however, is a
striking departure from the type, and I
never tire of admiring its artistic frame and
its kaleidoscopic tints. The larger red Bokharas,
where the pattern is fine, the texture
thin and silky, and the rug straight, are
very rich and handsome used as full single
<i>portières</i>. But a rug when hung, or used
as a <i>portière</i>, must be something entirely
out of the ordinary to be in keeping, rugs
in all such cases virtually competing with
and taking the place of old tapestries. The
substitute, therefore, should afford equal
delight to the eye. I turn this closely woven,
heavy Shiraz, with the nap running
toward the light, and its forest of fluctuant
palm leaves is blue. I spread it in the reverse
direction to see its color change like a
tourmaline, and the field become resilient
with soft rich greens. Dusty, soiled, and
dingy when I first saw it unrolled from the
bale, it is now a gem, alive to every change
of light and shade. Time has subdued
its original strong colors. These delicate
gleams of buff that dance upon the border
were once a pronounced brown-crimson,
while the original yellows of some of the
figures have softened to pale primrose. Its
blues and greens are alone unfaded, though
refined by age. The artist painted better
than he knew; or did he designedly leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the finishing touches to the master-hand of
Time?</p>

<p class='c001'>How strange this patch of shadow and
yonder gleam of light in this ancient Tiflis,
the shadow shifting to light and the light
darkening to shadow, as I reverse my position.
The cunning designer has suddenly
reversed the nap in the center, and hence
its puzzling changes. I marvel who has
knelt upon these Conia prayers, in whose
glowing centers four shades of blue and
four shades of red are fused so imperceptibly
you may scarcely tell where one shade
ends and another begins—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Tender tones of olive, yellow, and blue
lurk in some of the old Coulas, and suave
tints of peach-blow and of rose gleam in the
patterns of the rarer Kermans. Generally
speaking, the Coulas possess little claim to
distinction. But the finer old examples are
a marked exception, many resembling the
Yourdes prayers, while some are as velvety
and intricate in design as the old
Meccas. My most admired Coula (4 × 5)
in its pattern and coloring might have been
copied from an ancient cathedral window.</p>
<p class='c001'>This yellow Daghestan, coined four-score
years ago, is a veritable field of the cloth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>gold. There are also the precious old Persian
Sennas, with a diamond flashing in the
center, and a certain weave of Anatolians
with a bloom upon them like that of a ripe
plum, so velvety one wants to stroke them
just for the pleasure of the caress. When
viewed against the nap, they look almost
black, the colors hidden by the heavy fleece
till revealed by another angle of view.
What strange conceits, what fine-spun
webs of tracery, what fillets, tangles, and
tessellations of color do they not disclose!</p>

<p class='c001'>The command in the Khoran prohibiting
its followers from reproducing the image
of living things has not been without its
pronounced advantage. It has served to
develop the infinite beauty of geometrical
design. Color-study no edict of Mohammed
could banish; it is a sixth sense reflected
from the sky and atmosphere—a priceless
gift of Allah! There has long been wanting
a well-defined scale to describe and
place the different shades intelligibly, just
as there exists a standard of weights and
measures comprehensible by all. Artists
have one set of terms, shopmen and milliners
another; the average person can not
define a shade. Who can place the hues
of a sunset sky? There needs to be a
color-congress to form a closer chromatic
scale, and the task belongs by right to the
Orientals.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>As a class, the Kazaks are not as desirable
as many other makes, design and colorings
frequently being so obtrusive, and
the weave usually being marked by coarseness.
Yet some Kazaks there are of remarkable
beauty. My best examples of Kazak
art are done in cardinal and old gold.
The one is an antique, 6 × 7, thin and
finely woven, the ground-work in three
shades of red, with the “tree pattern” raised
in black upon the field, and a storm of
white flakes scattered over it. The other
is a very old piece of nearly similar size, in
perfect preservation, so heavy that to lift it
is a task. Its luster is marvelous. The
pattern is one of the most admired of all
the Kazak patterns when the colors are
happily employed, consisting of squares
within squares or octagons variously dispersed
upon the field, the largest figure in
the center. The colors consist simply of
four shades of yellow, the exquisite play of
light and shade produced by the glossy
texture of the wool employed and the frequent
shiftings of the nap heightening the
effect. It is my Asian Diaz, and my ship
contained it among her precious stores.</p>

<p class='c001'>Always among the most beautiful of
Persian and Turkish rugs are those of various
makes not often met with, that, exceptionally
heavy and glossy, possess a similar
tone to that of the Kazak just specified—blendings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and interblendings of russet,
chestnut, fawn, and fallow. To me their
sleek and velvety pile, their striped and
spotted surfaces, their turmoil of tawny
hues, possess an attraction akin to that of
the wild beasts of the remote Eastern jungle.
Looking at them, I instinctively recall
a carnivorous animal—fascinating in his
fulvous beauty, supreme in his splendor and
his sheen. These graceful arabesques, are
they not like the curving haunches of some
huge cat of the desert? These lucent spots
and markings, do they not resemble the
shimmering pelt of a couchant carnivore?
A strange fascination they possess for me; a
subdued ferity, even to the animal odor that
clings about their lambent folds; and, sometimes,
the gleams as of feline eyes that peer
from the dots of their borders.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Yourdes are among the few weaves
that do not acquire an additional value from
silkiness. Time mellows their naturally
soft shades, and use imparts to them a
slight luster. But their great value consists
in detail of design and contrast of a few
colors—black and dark bands on a gray-white
ground for the border, the plain
prayer-disks usually of gray, blue, green,
or maroon. The warp and nap being relatively
thin, and color and design not being
dependent upon strong or direct light to
emphasize them, they are excellently adapted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>for hangings—indeed, they are too tender
and precious to be placed upon the floor.
The antique Yourdes prayers usually come
in sizes about 4 × 6, and are deservedly
among the most prized among Oriental
textiles. Some of the finer Persians are
equally suitable for hangings. By Persians
I refer to what is known as “Persian
prayers,” the term being used to designate
a certain class of Persian fabrics with centers
of self-colors, to which, for some unexplained
reason, a more definite name is
not given. More strictly speaking, with
double disks, the larger one plain and the
smaller partially embroidered or figured,
the arabesque “a” and typical Shiraz figure
generally present in the border. These
Persians are recognizable at a glance. Can
we wonder the Moslem is so resigned to
prayer with such <i>prie-Dieus</i> to kneel upon!</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the term Daghestan are lumped
the makes of this and numerous other districts,
the designs of which are somewhat
similar. There are very many fine true
Daghestans and Kubas, as well as very
many poor ones, the old examples being
relatively much handsomer than the modern.
The ordinary Daghestan border repeats
itself far too often, and its commonness
mars many an otherwise valuable
work of art. Next to the Meccas, the
Daghestans are probably among the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>crooked of the products of Eastern looms,
and numberless specimens of extraordinary
sheen and rare design and coloring are
virtually spoiled on this account. A long
strip frequently has a horse-shoe curve, and
even very small pieces are often so much
broader at one end as to prove positively
distressing to the sense of proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The finer Meccas, distinguished for extreme
softness and silkiness, combined with
intricacy and pronounced individuality of
design, are generally not only very crooked,
but gathered and puffed at the corners as
well. A straight Mecca one rarely sees
except in dreams. This is to be deplored,
for their lovely arabesques and gracious
fantasies are not to be met with elsewhere.
A search for absolute geometrical
precision in Oriental rugs, however,
would be like Kaphira’s pursuit of the golden
ball. They are made and painted by
hand, and not cut out by machine. Therein
consists their enchantment. Nevertheless,
one should only look for and secure
comparatively straight specimens; the very
crooked, the very crude, and the very glaring
are worthless at any price. “A cur’s
tail,” says a Turkish adage, “may be
warmed and pressed and bound round with
ligatures, and after a twelve years’ labor bestowed
upon it, still it will retain its natural
form.” The dog in the adage was intended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>not for a Christian, but for a rug. No
wetting, stretching and tacking will remove
its aged seams and wrinkles—</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Distinct from all other productions are
the Kourdestans, notably the large anchor-pattern.
These are difficult to manage,
however, the design being so striking.
Very large figures or very glaring colors
are on this account to be avoided. They
tyrannize over their companions, or clash
with surrounding objects. The eye is perpetually
directed to them and they disturb
the sense of repose. Many specimens of
the Carabaghs are remarkable for their
beautiful combination of colors, especially
in the blending of reds, olives, and blues.
The nap is generally very heavy, and the
wool employed not unfrequently of extreme
glossiness, imparting almost an oily look to
the surface. The rather large hexagonal
figures, moreover, without being glaring
are usually artistic and striking. Handsome
are many of the Persian camel’s-hair
rugs, unique in design and usually of very
subdued colors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Cashmeres or Somaks are lacking
in animation compared with many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>weaves. Individuality they possess, but
neither sheen, softness of texture, nor
marked grace of design. For the dining-room,
the most serviceable rugs are the
large India, and the Turkish Ouchaks,
though when obtainable some of the finer
large Khorassans and Persians are equally
desirable. Both of the latter are finer than
the Ouchaks, and old pieces possess a
brilliant luster which the Ouchaks lack.
The fine large thick India rugs are among
the most magnificent in the world, soft as
a houri’s cheek, and diapered and jeweled
with every shade of color; yet harmonious
as the play of an opal. It is impossible to
conceive of more superb color-blending.</p>

<p class='c001'>While age is unquestionably an important
factor in the beauty of a rug, one should
by no means cast aside a new rug if the
example be exceptionally fine, and its design
or coloring may not be obtained in an
antique. It will require time, I admit, to
develop its beauties. But by subjecting it
to light and constant use its original crudeness
will gradually depart, and each year of
service will heighten its bloom. Against
the crude new fabric must be placed the far
more objectionable form of “antique,” torn
and thread-bare from rough usage, or soiled
and faded beyond redemption. Neither
may it be amiss to caution the novice, and
many so-styled amateurs, against the not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>unfrequent practice of dealers—aye, of merchants
in Constantinople, Ispahan, and
even Mecca itself—of <i>painting</i> old rugs to
mask their sordid condition, and gloze over
their hoary antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could the history of an old rug be
traced, what a tale might it not unfold!—the
Adventures of a Guinea were nothing
in comparison. Venerable before it was
secured by the itinerant collector in some
remote province, how many vicissitudes
and changes has it not passed through!
Lashed to the backs of patient dromedaries
goaded by the spears of fierce dragomen;
borne under the heat of a tropical sun amid
the toilsome march of the caravan; and
escaping the rapine of plundering tribes, it
arrived at the great marts of the East.
Here, unstrapped from the bale, it passed to
the bazaars, or the vast warerooms of the
merchantmen. There, perchance, its lovely
sheen caught the eye of a calculating middleman,
who purchased the bale to secure
the prize, passing it in turn to a third. Or,
while ransacking the treasures of a Stamboul
bazaar it was, perhaps, admired by a
rich profligate—a bauble for a new-found
flame. Or, did it figure in the collection of
some noted connoisseur whose effects on
his demise passed into unconversant or indifferent
hands? Youth and beauty may
have reposed upon it, and old age admired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>its bewitching hues. It may have overheard
many a lover’s tale; it may once
have graced a pasha’s wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fine Oriental rugs mere size seldom
governs their value, this being dependent
upon intrinsic beauty and rarity. Of course,
a splendid large piece is more valuable than
a similar example half its size, although the
fine large piece may not be worth the rarer
small one of some other make. Oddity
and rarity, when combined with beauty,
are the strongest factors in the value of a
rug. A sage-green or mauve centered
Yourdes, 6 × 4, may be without price, as
a small Rembrandt may command a hundred
times the price of a canvas double
its size. It all depends upon the artist.
Neither is thickness nor silkiness a necessary
factor in the value of a rug. Depth of pile
is certainly desirable in very many makes,
a heavy piece keeping its place upon the
floor far better than a thin one. Silkiness
is likewise valuable in most cases; it imparts
additional life, and enhances the play
of the color facets. But in rugs like the
rarer Yourdes and some of the old Persians
and Coulas, neither depth of pile nor extraordinary
luster govern their value. These
are paintings—old masters—that should be
hung, to be admired like a picture or a
stained-glass window, and the eye revel in
their beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>But my rugs are more than mere foci of
color and revelations of Eastern luxury.
They are, above all, examples of a rare
handicraft; enduring expressions of artistic
skill of various times and various peoples.
They thus become sentient instead of simply
material, their exuberance of hue and opulence
of design representing the most consummate
art, and appealing equally to me
through the various motives of human industry,
human interest, and human thought.
In them are incorporated the sense of the
beautiful as interpreted by the canons of
Oriental art, a distinct artistic motive and
theme underlying the technical finish and
manual skill of the craftsman. Nor is spiritual
quality less reflected in these masterpieces
than the fine æstheticism with which
they are pervaded; they express equally a
religious symbolism of the Oriental mind,
and the mystic rites observed in the mosque
of Islam. Just as painting and sculpture
are representative arts of Christian peoples,
so these marvelous blendings of form and
color are typical of the individuality of the
Mohammedan alien race.</p>

<p class='c001'>Endless is their variety. Independent
of the diversity of the different wools
employed, each district has its characteristic
patterns, its peculiar weaves, and often
its distinguishing colors and color-combinations
which are its individual right and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>inheritance, and which other districts may
not reproduce without incurring the opprobrium
attached to the plagiarist. Anatolia
may not borrow from Bokhara, nor
Daghestan from Beloochistan. Nor may one
rug of a district be an exact reproduction
of another rug of the same district. There
may be a resemblance, it is true; but each
valuable example will be found to possess
a stamp of originality—the genius of the
artist—which gives it its value and constitutes
the difference between the mere
commercial product and the enduring work
of art. Thou shalt not purloin the work of
another’s brain! is a commandment embossed
upon the loom of the Oriental—a
law of the Medes and Persians generally
observed unto this day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Valuable as a well-chosen collection of
porcelains is a well-chosen collection of rugs.
While neither may be dispensed with as
art objects, and both afford a constant delight
to the eye and the sense of the beautiful,
it may be said that textiles have the
advantage over porcelains in that they can
not break, and that they combine utility
with equal charm and more extended color.
It is, withal, a satisfaction to know that
every footfall upon their luxurious pile and
every beam of sunlight that streams upon
them only serve to increase their value and
heighten their beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>In the course of time, no doubt—aye,
at no distant day, as fine old specimens
become more and more rare and occupy,
as they deserve, a still more exalted place
in the domain of art—we will have exhibitions
of Oriental rugs, as we have exhibits
of paintings and statuary to-day. The
appreciative and wealthy amateur who, in
a single purchase, recently expended nineteen
thousand dollars for twelve specimens
of the Asiatic weaver’s art—specimens that
may not now be duplicated—will then be
envied for his foresight and the cheapness
of his purchase.</p>

<p class='c001'>To form a fine, varied, and extensive
collection of rugs, however, is the work of
years. As Paganini declared, after a lifetime
of study, that he had just begun to be
acquainted with his violin, so the connoisseur
may say with regard to the textiles he
loves so well. For every piece should be
like a painting, perfect of its kind, artistic
in design, harmonious in color; and to
combine the desired qualifications without
incongruities or repetition of borders and
patterns is to tread no primrose path. Not
only a concent of color and design is requisite
in each single example, but rarity, luster,
age, good condition, and individuality—a
combination not easily obtainable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But my ship contained many straight
and beautiful rugs among her stores!</p>

LOOKING out through the windows
of my house upon the sunset
sky, I am often enabled to frame
a weather report for the morrow;
for, in his rising and his
setting, the sun has a message to convey,
sometimes written in type that is legible to
all, sometimes in hieroglyphics that the ordinary
observer may not decipher. Yonder
blazing fire in the west and warm orange
afterglow tell me I may expect fair weather,
just as the leaden cloud which screens the
sinking sun apprises me of coming storm.
But to offset one aspect of the plainly lettered
sky, there are a score more difficult to
read, while, at best, we are liable to err in
our interpretations where the weather is
concerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, trying as it often is, in this latitude
especially, how could we dispense with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>vagaries? Sunshine, by all means! but we

shone, even could vegetation and humanity
exist under unclouded skies.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It has been observed before now that we
are always talking about the weather, always
interested in it, always trying to foretell
it, always grumbling at it, or delighted
with it. Without the changes of the
weather the world would go all awry.
There would be no more guessing or prognosticating.
Conversation must come to a
standstill; if not to a full stop, at least to an
awkward pause. When there is nothing
else to talk about there is always the weather.
It is the oil of conversation’s wheel.
How many a pleasant acquaintance dates
from a weather remark! Simply as a conversational
factor I have no doubt it has
helped on innumerable marriages. But it
is ever too hot or too cold, too damp or
too dry, too cloudy or too sunshiny. If one
can not openly anathematize his neighbor,
he may damn the weather; faint, indeed, is
its praise. With a bright sun shining, a
purple haze on the hills, the thermometer at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>50°, and the atmosphere exhilarating as
champagne, still the lament will arise that
we are not enveloped with a blanket of
snow. Just the day for a walk, when one
may start out dry-shod to inhale the stimulating
air and bask in voluptuous sunlight!
But the fickle weather-vane suddenly
veers, and north wind and snow are exchanged
for south wind and balm; the
croakers have their turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe that the
weather repeats itself in a general way at
regular intervals of seven or ten years, more
or less. Statistics are said to confirm this
statement, and it gives us reason to hope
that when our records shall cover longer
periods and shall be more carefully and
fully compiled, we may obtain considerable
insight into the weather programme for the
coming year. That one extreme follows
another is perhaps the surest and most
valuable weather indicator we have. An
inordinate degree of warmth is generally
followed by a corresponding degree of cold;
a period of extraordinary coolness by a contrasting
period of heat. The amount of
water and heat in the world is always the
same, though to human observation the extremes
of temperature are capriciously distributed.
If it is passing cold here, it is passing
warm somewhere else. If we get an
overplus of wet this month we receive an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>overplus of dry next month, or some month
after. Nature will surely balance her ledger
sooner or later; the difficulty is to tell when
she will do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Restless and impatient, man is continually
seeking change. What could supply
this inherent craving in the breast of mankind
so happily as the weather? The old
adage, “’Tis an ill wind blows no man
good,” is daily verified. This change to
piercing cold means one hundred thousand
tons more of coal for the furnaces of each of
the great cities; this hot wave, one hundred
thousand tons more of ice to their refrigerators.
The mild winter that brings a scowl
upon the dry-goods merchant’s face is a
benison to the laborer; the east wind that
puts out the inland furnace fires may blow
the disabled vessel into port. Blowing
where it listeth, to some point of the compass
the wind is kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>If one could find no other occupation,
one might busy himself in making observations
of the weather. In the shifting vane
and the restless clouds there is the attraction
of perpetual change, elements we may
not control nor yet fully understand—an
omnipresent and omnipotent force. Their
wayward moods bring plenty or pestilence,
as the vane chooses to veer, or the tangles
gather in the <i>cirri’s</i> hair. All animal and
vegetable life is dependent upon their inexorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>decrees. The laws of the weather
may not be altered. We may not increase
the rainfall one inch or lower the temperature
half a degree. The most we can do is
to study its warnings, and, by reading the
signs of the earth and sky, be prepared for
what changes may be in store.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a relief from the tyranny of hard
fact in endeavoring to trace the meaning of
these <i>nimbus</i> clouds or the prophecy of this
moisture-laden breeze. What will the next
change be; of what complexion will be the
weather to come? I foretell it frequently
through my walls of glass that enable me
from within to read the horoscope of the
sky. The signs exist, if we may but comprehend
them. They publish every event
and indicate every change. Unvarying
laws that may be understood by the intelligent
observer control all atmospheric conditions,
and particularly storms. By noting
existing conditions the corollary is to be
deduced. Blasius’s laws, as stated in his
volume, Storms, are comprehensive, and
whoever will take the pains to study them
(for many portions of the volume call for
hard study) may learn to foretell much
about the weather, at least so far as relates
to larger storms. Many immediate changes
are easy to foretell—from the moon’s warning
halo and the prophesying cry of the
hair-bird, to the toad’s prescient croak from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the tree. From observation the farmer and
mariner generally become weather-wise.
Out in the open air continually, they learn
to interpret the signs, their vocations being
more or less controlled by and dependent
upon the weather. A habit of studying the
weather brings one into closer relationship
with nature. However superficial the
knowledge, one must know something of
nature in order to be a weather-prophet,
that is, so far as prophesying from numerous
well-known natural signs is concerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are certain indices: the clouds no
bigger than a man’s hand, that indicate
what is coming in a weather way for a
short time ahead. Many of the old signs
are reliable. From time out of mind a red
sunset has been viewed as a precursor of
fair weather, and a red sunrise the forerunner
of storm. A bright-yellow sky at sunset
uniformly denotes wind, a coppery or
pale-yellow sunset, wet; and attentive observers
do not need the testimony of Admiral
Fitzroy to know that a dark, gloomy,
blue sky is windy, and a light, bright, blue
sky is fair. A high dawn indicates wind,
a low dawn fine weather. A gray sky in
the morning presages fine weather. If
<i>cumulus</i> gathers in the north and rises,
rain may be looked for before night. Frequently
the <i>cumuli</i> clouds—argosies serenely
riding at anchor above the southern horizon—flash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>forth warnings that are never
fulfilled; the lightning of heat, and not of
storm. If stripes are seen to rise northward
from the southern sky, a change may be anticipated
from their quarter. Without clouds
there can be no storm.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most beautiful cloud-formations,
the mackerel-sky, is well known to
be usually indicative of a change. Oftentimes
on the otherwise unclouded blue of
the heavens delicate volutes or scrolls may
be observed, like cobwebs spun upon the
sky; these frequently portend a decided
change within two days. If this form of
cloud, more familiarly known as mares’-tails,
curls down toward sunset, fair weather
may be looked for; if up, it will most probably
rain before dawn. Frequently narrow
bands or stripes extend from east to west or
north to south over the entire aërial arch,
the storm invariably coming from the direction
pointed out by the clouds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Local signs go to show that in winter a
dark-blue cloud over the lake foretells a
thaw; when the lower portion, however,
is dark and the upper portion gray, snow
may be expected. A halo round the moon
is a sure indication of rain, snow, or wind,
and the larger the circle the nearer the
storm. When the stars are more than
usually bright and numerous, or when the
hills and distant objects seem unusually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>sharp and near, I am certain of an approaching
storm. “You all know the peculiar
clearness which precedes rain,” observes
Ruskin, “when the distant hills are looking
nigh. I take it on trust from the scientific
people that there is then a quantity,
almost to saturation, of aqueous vapor in
the air, but it is aqueous vapor in a state
which makes the air more transparent than
it would be without it. What state of
aqueous molecule is that, absolutely unreflective
of light—perfectly transmissive of
light, and showing at once the color of blue
water and blue air on the distant hills?”
Distant sounds heard with unusual distinctness
apprise me of rain. The aurora
borealis, when very bright, is usually followed
by a storm, and often intense cold.
The rainbow after drought is a rain-sign.</p>

<p class='c001'>Natural signs, other than the handwriting
on the sky, are innumerable, and, again,
the old sign-posts point out the way. Heavy
dews indicate fair weather, while three consecutive
white frosts, and often two, invariably
bring rain or snow. Before a snow-storm
the weather usually moderates, while
there is always an interval between the first
drops and the downpour. If it rains before
seven it will clear before eleven, is a wise
saw. Certain stones, which, when rain is
in the near future, become damp and dark-looking,
are excellent barometers. We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>all of us noticed that fire frequently burns
brighter and throws out more heat just before
a storm, and is hotter during its continuance—an
easterly storm, however, often
being the exception.</p>

<p class='c001'>The closing of the blossoms of numerous
flowers during the day tells me it will
rain; my flowers also give out a stronger
odor previous to rain. The trefoils contract
their leaves at the approach of a storm.
The convolvulus and the pimpernel also
fold their petals previous to rain, the latter
flower being appropriately named the poor
man’s weather-glass. When the chickweed’s
blossom expands fully, no rain will
occur for several hours; if it continue open,
no rain will fall during the day. When it
half conceals its flower the day is usually
showery. When it entirely closes its white
petals, steady rain will occur. “It is manifest,”
observes Bacon in Sylva Sylvarum,
“that there are some <i>Flowers</i> that have
<i>Respect</i> to the <i>Sunne</i> in two kindes; The
one by <i>Opening</i> and <i>Shutting</i>; And the
other by <i>Bowing</i> and <i>Inclining</i> the <i>Head</i>;
it is found in the great Flower of the <i>Sunne</i>;
in <i>Marigolds</i>, <i>Wart-Wort</i>, <i>Mallow-Flowers</i>;
and others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Smoke rising straight in the air means
fair weather. The odor of the <i>Mephitis</i> is
very pronounced before rain, owing to the
heaviness of the atmosphere, which prevents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>odors from rising. Spiders do not
spin their webs out of doors before rain.
Previous to rain flies sting sharper, bees remain
in their hives, or fly but short distances,
and most animals and birds appear
uneasy. “Sheep,” the Selborne rector
states, “are observed to be very intent on
grazing against stormy wet evenings.” One
of the most reliable weather-signs in Texas
is said to be supplied by the ant. The ants
bring their eggs up out of their nests, exposing
them to the sun to be hatched.
When they are observed carrying them in
again hastily, though there be not a cloud
in the sky, a storm is near at hand. Swallows
flying low near the ground or water
is a rain-sign noted in the Georgics, the
birds following the flies and gnats which
delight in a warm strata of air. Aratus, the
Greek poet, in the Prognostica, also cites
the swallow’s flight low over the water as
a rain-sign:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fast skim the swallows o’er the lucid lake</div>
      <div class='line'>And with their breasts the rippling waters break.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Previous to rain and just when it begins to
rain, swallows fly swifter, doubtless to
make the most of the insects while opportunity
affords. Wheeling and diving high
in the sky, the swallow flies to tell me the
day will be fair. Chickens, it may be noticed,
when steady rain sets in will continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>searching for food after the rain has begun;
if only a shower they will seek shelter before
the rain begins. Foxes bark, and
wolves howl more frequently when wet
weather is approaching. Crows clamor
louder before a change. Frogs, geese,
and crows were looked upon as weather-prophets
by the ancients, the crow especially
figuring frequently as a foreboder of storm.
According to Virgil, if they croak often, and
with a hoarse voice it is a rain-sign:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tum cornix rauca pluviam vocat improba voce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>If they croak only three or four times, and
with a shrill clear voice it is a fair weather-sign:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tum liquidas corvi presso ter guttere voces</div>
      <div class='line'>Aut quater ingeminant.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Lucretius likewise introduces the crow as a
weather-prophet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... om’nous crows with various noise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Affright the farmers; and fill all the plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now calling for rough winds and now for rain.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c022'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Creeche’s translation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c023'>The crow’s raucous voice also figures in
Aratus’s Prognostics of a Storm:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The aged crow on sable pinions borne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the beetling promontory stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tells the advancing storm to trembling lands;</div>

      <div class='line'>Or, croaking hoarse, wheels round in circles dark and wide.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c022'><sup>[5]</sup></a></div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>And Chaucer, while following the majority
of the poets in aspersing the crow, still
makes him serve as a barometer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ne nevir aftir swete noise shall ye make,</div>
      <div class='line'>But evir crye ayenst tempest and rain....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>All nature reads the coming signs. The
migratory woodcock will desert the fall
covers in advance of the storm, even though
the weather promise fair. Just before a
storm, like its echo in advance, I have heard
the Canadian forest resounding on every
side with the cry of the great horned owl—<i>oh-hoo,
oh-hoo! oh-hoo, oh-hoor-r-r-r</i>!
Wild fowl are conscious of the change from
afar. Even the domestic goose and duck
are unusually garrulous previous to a storm,
voicing their pleasure at the prospect of
approaching rain. I recall a case in point
while trout-fishing, where geese proved
excellent weather-prophets. The day in
question, September 14, 1875, the last day
of the open season in Ontario, like the three
or four preceding days, was warm, hazy,
and delightful, with no perceptible omens
to denote an approaching storm, save the
graceful mares’-tails waving from the sky.
But a large flock of geese, which appeared
to dispute with the trout the possession of
the pond, and which had frequently proved
a source of annoyance while angling, were
more than usually excited, screaming continually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and flying to and from the pond
with loud gaggling. The sun descended
behind the tamaracks with an angry frown,
the moon became obscured by ominous
clouds, the temperature fell suddenly, and a
severe equinoctial storm set in.</p>

<p class='c001'>Birds, however, can not be implicitly
relied upon as weather-prophets, especially
as harbingers of spring. Year after
year, tempted by instinct and the tempered
air, do the migratory birds take early flights
to the northward. Suddenly on some genial
morning, the vanguards appear. A blue-bird’s,
or song-sparrow’s dulcet warble falls
upon the ear, and we welcome the return
of spring. But season after season we have
to record the disappearance of the birds
again, and the recurrence of stormy weather.
Lured by the soft spring sunshine, and
eager to revisit their northern homes, the
birds, like human migrants to the south,
frequently return too soon. Not until I
hear the first sweet song of the white-throated
sparrow am I convinced that spring
has come to stay.</p>

<p class='c001'>How far the weather is influenced by
the changes of the moon is a disputed question.
M. de Parville, a French meteorologist
of note, has recently claimed that a
long series of observations show that the
moon which passes every month from one
hemisphere to the other, influences the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>direction of the atmospheric currents; that
the distance of the moon from the equator,
or inclination of the moon’s path to the
plane of the equator varies every year, passing
from a maximum to a minimum limit,
and that the meteorological character of a
series of years appears to be mainly dependent
upon the change of inclination when
those extreme limits have been touched:
the rainy years, the cold winters, and hot
summers return periodically and coincide
with certain declinations of the moon. In
proof of his assertion, he presents a table
tracing backward this connection between
the rainy years and the moon’s declination.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the European Magazine, vol. 60, p.
24, a table is given which has been ascribed
to the astronomer Herschel. It is constructed
upon a philosophical consideration
of the attraction of the sun and moon in
their several positions respecting the earth,
suggesting to the observer what kind of
weather will most probably follow the
moon’s entrance into any of her quarters.
Briefly summarized, the nearer the time of
the moon’s entrance, at full and change or
quarters, is to midnight (that is within two
hours before and after midnight), the more
fair the weather is in summer, but the nearer
to noon, the less fair. Also, the moon’s
entrance, at full, change, and quarters, during
six of the afternoon hours, viz.: from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>four to ten, may be followed by fair weather;
but this is mostly dependent on the
wind. The same entrance during all the
hours after midnight, except the two first,
is unfavorable to fair weather.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be of interest to cite Bacon’s
rules for prognosticating the weather, from
the appearances of the moon:</p>

<p class='c001'>1. If the new moon does not appear till
the fourth day, it prognosticates a troubled
air for the whole month.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. If the moon either at her first appearance
or within a few days after, has her
lower horn obscured and dusky, it denotes
foul weather before the full; but, if she be
discovered about the middle, storms are to
be expected about the full; and, if her <i>upper</i>
horn be affected, about the wane.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. When on her fourth day the moon
appears pure and spotless, her horns unblunted
and neither flat nor quite erect, but
between both, it promises fair weather for
the greatest part of the month.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. An erect moon is generally threatening
and unfavorable, but particularly denotes
wind; though if she appears with
short and blunted horns, rain is rather to be

<p class='c001'>The influence of the moon on the
weather was one of the cardinal beliefs, not
only of the ancients, but of our forefathers,
and the old gardeners and orchardists believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>implicitly in its effect on most operations
connected with husbandry, regulating
these operations with the greatest exactitude,
according to the various phases of the
planet. Harvard, in his treatise on the art
of propagating plants, referring to the proper
time for grafting, declares, “the grafts
must alwaies be gathered in the old of the
Moone.” Lawson, in his New Orchard
and Garden, advises as the best time to remove
sets, “immediately after the fall of
the Leaf, in or about the change of the
Moon;” and the best time for “graffing”
as “in the last part of <i>February</i> or <i>March</i>,
or beginning with <i>April</i>, when the Sun
with his heat begins to make the sap stir
more rankly about the change of the Moon,
before you see any great apparancie of leaf
or flowers; but only knots and buds, and
before they be proud, though it be sooner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Very frequent references to the moon’s
influence with respect to forestry and its
operations occur in Evelyn’s Sylva. In
felling timber, he charges the forester to
“observe the <i>Moons</i> increase” (chap. iii,
13). And again, “the fittest time of the
<i>Moon</i> for the <i>Pruning</i> is (as of <i>Graffing</i>)
when the <i>sap</i> is ready to stir (not proudly
stirring) and so to cover the <i>wound</i>” (chap.
xxix, 6.) The old lunar rules for felling
trees are thus given by Evelyn (chap. xxx,
26): “Fell in the <i>decrease</i>, or four days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>after <i>conjunction</i> of the two great <i>Luminaries</i>;
some of the last quarter of it; or (as
Pliny) in the very article of the <i>change</i>, if
possible; which hapning (saith he) in the
last day of the Winter <i>Solstice</i>, that <i>Timber</i>
will prove <i>immortal</i>: At least should it be
from the <i>twentieth</i> to the <i>thirtieth</i> day, according
to <i>Columella</i>: <i>Cato</i> four dayes
after the <i>Full</i>, as far better for the growth:
But all <i>viminious</i> Trees <i>silente Lunâ</i>; such
as <i>Sallies</i>, <i>Birch</i>, <i>Poplar</i>, etc. <i>Vegetius</i>
for <i>ship timber</i>, from the <i>fifteenth</i> to the
<i>twenty-fifth</i>, the <i>Moon</i> as before; but never
during the <i>Increase</i>, Trees being then most
abounding with moisture, which is the
only source of putrefaction: And yet ’tis
affirm’d upon unquestionable <i>Experience</i>,
that <i>Timber</i> cut at any <i>season</i> of the <i>year</i>,
in the <i>Old Moon</i>, or last <i>Quarter</i>, when
the <i>Wind</i> blows <i>Westerly</i>; proves as
<i>sound</i>, and good as at any other period
whatsoever; nay, all the whole <i>Summer</i>
long, as in any <i>Month</i> of the <i>Year</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Few of our large storms are of local origin;
they are hatched for the most part on
the plains east of the Rocky Mountains, and
thence move eastward, deflecting slightly
to the north during winter. In Europe, the
meteorologists assert, storms are more
nearly round than in America, where they
are of a more irregular oval form, varying
in size from the diameter of a few miles to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>those that surge from the gulf to beyond
the lakes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Blasius for storms! the supreme
authority, the Aristotle of the clouds and
air-currents. When all our ordinary signs
fail, we have only to turn to the Hanover
professor to read and learn.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unquestionably, nevertheless, the most
infallible of weather rules is that there is no
rule. So far as ordinary signs go, there is
nothing more true than that all signs may
fail during a protracted drought, or continuous
rainy weather. Vainly then the
peacock screams, or the sun emerges from
a dripping sky. At best the weather is a
hoiden, and, perhaps, loves a frown better
than a dimple. The rain may come and
the rain may go, persistently following the
course of a lake or river, favoring this locality
and slighting that; deluging one county
to leave the adjoining one parched with
thirst. For it is true of the weather and
other things besides; it never smiles but
it laughs, it never rains but it pours.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>IV.<br /> <br />THE IDEAL HAVEN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>When my ship comes home I shall have a study of a
very superior kind built. A part of the scheme will be
a garden and a greenhouse which shall be especially
adapted to the exigencies of authorcraft.—<span class='sc'>J. Ashby-Sterry,
Cucumber Chronicles.</span></p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_2'>
WHILE silence is pre-eminently golden
in the study, the study, nevertheless
should be more than
“a chamber deaf to noise.”
Situated away from disturbing
household sounds, it should also be withdrawn
from ready access on the part of all
intruders. It should be a “den” in the literal
sense of the word—a covert, a haven.
Not that it should necessarily be below
ground, but the way leading to it should be
difficult to find; and, like the fox’s den, it
should be provided with two entrances or
means of escape, the more readily to baffle
pursuers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In how many houses, even those which
are supposed to have been most carefully
planned, are not the library and the study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>placed in close proximity to the front entrance,
where anything like continuous repose
is as far removed as the constellation
Orion, and where the volume with which
one endeavors to be engaged is forever
chafed by the friction of passing inmates!
Apart from mere noise, the discomfort of
a library or study so situated is always great
from the facility it offers to the wiles of
innumerable outside forces. It is necessarily
unpleasant to have certain visitors thrust
unceremoniously upon one. You can not
tell by the mere ring of the bell whether it
is A, B, or C who has come to honor you
with his presence—to bore or to charm;
and without at every announcement making
a sudden dive at the risk of being seen
or heard, you are liable to be chambered for
an hour with the very person you may most
desire to avoid. Thoreau often waited for
the Visitor who never comes; many of us
must wait for the visitor who never goes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not that I would limit visitors to a circumscribed
few, or banish welcome ones at
an early hour. I entertain the highest regard
for the maxim of Pope respecting the
coming and the parting guest; yet, in the
very nature of things, there are always some
to whom one would fain send the conventional
message, “not at home.” It was
to obviate such monstrous misplacements
as a library near the front door (a library
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>merely in name), that Naudé, years since,
in his Advis pour dresser une Bibliothèque,
gave this excellent advice: “Let the library
be placed in a portion of the house most removed
from noise and disturbance, not only
from without, but also from family and
servants; away from the street, the kitchen,
sitting-room, and similar places; locating
it, if possible, between some spacious court
and a fine garden where it may have abundant
light, pure air, and extended and agreeable
views.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of all houses where rooms
are thus misplaced, some means of spiriting
one’s self away through a side or rear door
are absolutely essential to even a semblance
of comfort. A study amid such surroundings,
without safe and instantaneous means
of flight from unwelcome callers is a grotesque
misnomer. Is not a man’s house his
castle? The term “growlery,” often applied
to the study, undoubtedly arose from
an apartment so situated, referring not to a
cage where the master of the house may
work off his surly moods, as some ladies
erroneously suppose, but to the anathemas
bestowed by its harassed inmate upon the
architect who planned a place for retirement
where retirement is only possible after midnight.
All these can the more readily comprehend
the force of a passage in Walden-“the
mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>what is called resignation is confirmed
desperation.” A trap-door, concealed
by an Oriental rug, that would respond
to a certain pressure of the foot known
only to the initiated, might be worthy of
consideration by house-builders in this connection.
Or some kind of reflecting-glass
might be devised that would enable coming
events of an unpleasant nature to cast their
shadows before.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even though one meet his modest accounts
with all reasonable promptitude,
there are still creditors oblivious to the
amenities of life, who, instead of forwarding
annual or semi-annual statements
through the certain channel of the mails,
send their “cards of compliment” for collection
through the medium of middlemen
or runners, who, even yet more callous to
the finer feelings of humanity, and intent
solely upon pouching their guerdon, invariably
present themselves at the front door to
force a passage within. Fancy an intrusion
of this kind while you may be rereading
The Eve of St. Agnes, or perusing The
Good-Natured Man! Though it occur
but once a year, the shock must still remain.
At one time or another this form of
visitant is bound to appear to every one;
for the species of fiend exists in common
with front-door book-agents, itinerant venders,
census-takers, expressmen, telegraph-messengers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and the rest of the customary
mob that charges upon one’s front entrance
wherever and whenever it is the most accessible
means of invasion. Even the parcels’-delivery,
despite reiterated warnings,
will not unfrequently persist in demanding
ingress through the forbidden portal. Indeed,
the front door is a constant factor of
discord, the baiting-place of disquiet, the
arch enemy of household peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the vexations that are ever striving
to wedge their way through the vestibule
may be avoided by intelligent, well-drilled
servants who are capable of reading
human nature, and at a glance can distinguish
the false from the true. A thoroughly
competent house-maid should wear her cap
internally as well as externally, and, like a
thrasher’s sieve, be able to winnow the
chaff from the wheat. But such discriminating
Cerberi are as rare as they are desirable,
and the melancholy fact exists that the
servant is invariably ready to leave so soon
as she or he has become really valuable or
thoroughly accustomed to your ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lamb, in one of his essays on Popular
Fallacies, has said some excellent things
about visitors. If certain visitors would
only read these things, and, reading, comprehend!
And if the visitor who never
knows when to leave, as distinguished from
those who, staying late, always leave too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>soon, would only peruse and ponder! In
his category of intruders Lamb emphasizes
“purposeless visitants and droppers-in,”
and he sometimes wonders from what sky
they fall. Whittier’s Demon of the Study,
too, would indicate that the type still flourishes
in New as well as Old England. Under
the inspiration of an architect who is yet
to be born, the house of the millennium will
be able to avoid all unpleasant intrusions
upon a privacy that is its inherent right, but
which, alas! exists not in the home of the
present.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is apparent at once that the ideal haven
can not hide itself amid the turmoil of
the first floor. To fulfill its mission it must
betake itself to surroundings more retired,
and soar to a serener sphere. The true
place for the study, therefore, is on an upper
floor, and in the ideal house I would have it
a spacious oriel approached by a hidden
staircase.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hawthorne’s idea was an excellent one—the
study in the tower or upper story of
his residence at Concord, which he approached
by a ladder and trap-door, pulling
the ladder up after him, and placing a
weight over the door for additional security.
Here he could look out upon his favorite
walk amid the evergreens, almost touch the
crowns of the leafy elms, and bathe in the
sunshine that illumined the fertile plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>across the roadway. His first residence at
Concord—the Old Manse—was sufficiently
remote to dispense with a trap-door, unless,
indeed, this was an after-consideration
owing to family reasons. At an opposite
extremity of the village, far removed from
Emerson and even the fleet feet of Thoreau,
situated at a distance from the highway,
the house itself of a gray neutral tone to
baffle observation, and half concealed amid
the shade of the distant suburbs, he was
here free from all external annoyances.
Here in the retired three-windowed study
in the rear of the house, which overlooked
the romantic Concord River below, he
could set about his chosen task with no
dread of interruption from the outside
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Montaigne’s was a model study, a true
sanctum. Without the quiet and reclusion
it afforded, the pervading charm of the Essays
would never have been ours. Instead
of sauntering and loitering along with the
easy abandon they do, they would have
hurried and galloped by at breakneck speed,
striding the noisy highway rather than pacing
the shady lane. The placid, thinking,
receptive mind of Montaigne was obviously
the direct outcome of the calm and tranquillity
exhaled by the inaccessible round
Tower of Périgord.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enchanting landscape, too, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>smiled through the spacious windows was,
no doubt, a constant inspiration, serving to
rest the eye and mind when they were
wearied by the tyranny of print, or fatigued
by protracted writing. There would doubtless
be more Montaignes were it possible to
reproduce the life and surroundings amid
which the Essays were inspired. Genius
is capable of much; but, to be at its best,
even genius must be in the mood, and moods
are largely the result of surroundings. “No
doubt,” observes Lord Lytton, “the cradle
and nursery of definite thought is in the
hazy limbo of Reverie. There ideas float
before us, rapid, magical, vague, half
formed; apparitions of the thoughts that
are to be born later into the light, and run
their course in the world of man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Like the rain of night,” remarks Henri
Amiel in the Journal Intime, “reverie restores
color and force to thoughts which
have been blanched and wearied by the
heat of the day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The true flavor of a fine vintage may
not be savored if the wine be roiled, or
served at an improper temperature; the
fine effluence that should emanate from the
study—the framing of one’s mood and the
molding of one’s thoughts, is only to be
obtained in its perfect measure when the
mind is freed from all disturbing influences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us mount the classic staircase with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Montaigne, and view the apartment so
minutely described in the third chapter of
the Third Book. The well-filled book-cases,
the sunlight, the seclusion, the inviting
prospect, the fireplace, and the immunity
from noise, all are there:</p>

<p class='c001'>“At home I betake me somewhat
the oftener to my library, whence all at
once I command and survey all my household;
it is seated in the chiefe entrie of my
house, thence I behold under me my garden,
my base court, my yard, and looke
even into most roomes of my house. There
without order, without method, and by
peece-meales I turn over and ransacke,
now one booke and now another. Sometimes
I muse and rave; and walking up
and downe I endight and enregister these
my humours, these my conceits. It is
placed on the third storie of a tower. The
lowermost is my Chapell; the second a
chamber with other lodgings, where I often
lie because I would be alone. Above it is a
great wardrobe. It was in times past the
most unprofitable place of all my house.
There I past the greatest part of my lives
dayes, and weare out most houres of the
day. I am never there a nights: Next
unto it is a handsome neat cabinet, able
and large enough to receive fire in winter,
and very pleasantly windowen. And if I
feared not care, more than cost; (care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>which drives and diverts me from all businesse)
I might easily joyne a convenient
gallerie of a hundred paces long, and twelve
broad, on each side of it, and upon one
floore; having already for some other purpose,
found all the walles raised unto a
convenient height. Each retired place requireth
a walke. My thoughts are prone
to sleepe, if I sit long. My minde goes not
alone as if ledges did moove it. Those
that studie without bookes, are all in the
same case. The forme of it is round, and
hath no flat side, but what serveth for my
table and my chaire: In which bending or
circling manner, at one looke it offreth me
the full sight of all my books, set round
about upon shelves or desks, five rancks one
upon another. It hath three bay-windowes,
of a farre-extending, rich and unresisted
prospect, and is in diameter sixteen paces
wide. In winter I am less continually
there: for my house (as the name of it importeth)
is pearched upon an overpearing
hillocke; and hath no part more subject to
all wethers than this: which pleaseth me
the more, both because the accesse unto it
is somewhat troublesome and remote, and
for the benefit of the exercise which is to be
respected; and that I may the better seclude
myselfe from companie, and keepe incroachers
from me: There is my seat, that is my
throne. I endeavour to make my rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>therein absolute, and to sequester that only
corner from the communitie of wife, of children,
and of acquaintance. Else-where
I have but a verball authoritie, of confused
essence. Miserable in my minde is he,
who in his owne home, hath no where
to be to himselfe; where he may particularly
court, and at his pleasure hide or
with-draw himself. Ambition paieth her
followers well, to keepe them still in open
view, as a statue in some conspicuous
place.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c022'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Aside from the quiet, sequestration, and
conveniences of the philosopher’s study, it
will be observed that among its many desirable
features was that of its being “very
pleasantly windowen” (<i>très-plaisamment
percé</i>), the windows commanding a “farre-extending,
rich, and unresisted prospect”
(<i>trois veuës de riche et libre prospect</i>).
Assuredly the sunshine and light that
warmed and brightened the apartment, and
the unlimited view of hill and plain, were a
stimulus to the writer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunate is he who has a pleasing prospect
to look in upon him—it invigorates
and cheers like a cordial. Whatever the
time of year, the distant hills, visible through
my windows, are a source of companionship
and charm. So constantly are they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>before me, I have begun to consider them
as my own, a remote part of the garden and
the grounds to which they form the frame.
I love to watch their changing expression
and note their play of light and shade.
Meseems they almost resemble a human
countenance in the varying sentiments they
convey. Content and malcontent are as
plainly expressed by their mobile curves as
they are by the lines of the human face.
Like the rest of us, in sunshine they smile,
in storm they frown. They are warm, or
cool, as the mood takes them; as they reflect
or absorb the sky and atmosphere.
For days they rest in absolute calm; again
they recede, and, again, they advance.
Mirroring every change of the day and of
the passing seasons, they are a dial that
tells the hour, the time of year to me. The
sun salutes one side of their profile the first
thing in the morning; his parting rays
illumine the other side the last thing in the
evening. They hasten the dawn, and prolong
the twilight. The full moon rising
from the far horizon behind them, silvers
their wooded slopes ere it gilds the topmost
gables of my house. They catch the first
drops of the summer shower, and receive
the first flakes of the November snow.
The loveliest blues and purples seek them,
drawing a semi-transparent veil over them.
On hot summer noontides the cloud-flocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>repose upon them, and the orange
afterglow lingers long upon their tranquil
heights. In spring the earliest violets
carpet their sheltered places; in autumn
they yield me the last blue gentian
bloom. I see the wind lifting their green
skirts, and fancy I hear his voice murmuring
through their umbrageous depths. My
hills ever catch and focus color, and toy and
play with wind and sun. Whether shimmering
in midsummer glare, or standing
out against the wintry sky, or slumbering
in the haze of the dreamy autumnal day,
they are my finest landscape paintings.
When the snow has spread its shroud over
the silent fields they still speak to me in
color—gray, bronze, and purple—by turns
during the day; a kaleidoscope of tones
when the sun sinks behind their serried
ranks of trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing them thus year after year they
have come to possess a personality; and
when a rarefied atmosphere brings them
unusually near, I find myself casting an
imaginary lasso at them to bring them still
closer to me that I may stroke their lovely
contours. So familiar have I become with
them, I have only to look out of my windows,
and I am treading their luminous
heights, and am fanned by the breeze that
perpetually blows upon their peaceful
crests.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>With the wind from the southeast, I hear
the roar of the railroad trains, panting and
steaming, coming and going along their
slopes, leaving a trail of smoke to mark the
passage of their flight. The ceaseless tide
of travel ever hurries on. How many of
those seated in the luxurious coaches note
the beauty of my hills? Cloud-shadows
chase each other, and hawks wheel over
their summits, while the train speeds on,
intent upon overtaking other hills and its
remote destination: the beauty of my hills
remains for me.</p>

<p class='c001'>A knock at my study-door interrupts
my musings, and my hills abruptly recede.
Not that my friend Sherlock drives them
away; he is so versatile and colorful himself
that the charm of his presence and conversation
takes the place of my hills. I
never learned until to-day why he has remained
a bachelor. It was only when conversing
about the ideal home that the true
reason occurred to me—he has failed, not in
discovering the ideal woman, but the ideal
architect to carry out his admirable conceptions
of the perfect house; and rather than
fall below his artistic standard he passively
submits to fate, and awaits the architect
who is to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You seem to overlook the probability
of my being referred to a committee <i>inquirendo
lunatico</i>, should my views ever be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>carried out; and it seems dangerous to
commit them to print,” was my friend’s
rejoinder to a request that he present his
views in detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the simple story of my house will
at most be read by a few,” I replied; “and
these few will charitably give us credit for
good intentions; moreover the critics are
not nearly as black as they are painted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My ideas,” continued my friend, “fly
so rudely in the face of all convention that
people would consider the order of Nature
reversed. ‘A kitchen in the front yard!’
I hear them say, ‘Away with him!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless, had I the courage of my
convictions, together with ten times as
much money as I shall ever possess, I
would build my house all front, and no
rear!</p>

<p class='c001'>“A capacious vestibule, say 20 × 20
feet, should be, not the entrance exactly,
but a means of exclusion for unwelcome
visitors. A door on one side should open
to my lady’s reception-room where she
should receive all formal and business calls;
in short, every one whom she took no pleasure
in seeing at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This reception-room should be connected
with the domestic end of the house;
the store-rooms, servants’ hall, kitchen,
kitchen-pantries, and, <i>back of these</i>, the
dining- and breakfast-rooms.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“On the opposite side of the vestibule
should be a door, similarly accommodating
all unwelcome guests of the master, being
the entrance to the office, and connected by
a heavy <i>portière</i> and door with the den
and library. From these masculine apartments
a staircase, concealed in the wall,
should enable the good man of the house to
disappear to his bath- and dressing-room;
and there should also be an outer side-door
from the den, through which could be
‘fired’ (and admitted also) such tardy and
bibulous friends as might meet the disapproval
of madame.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The back of the vestibule should open
and expand into the hall—a great living-room
connecting the library at one end
with the dining-room at the other, and out
of which should open such little parlors and
snuggeries as inventive genius might suggest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Into this hall, the real house, only
those one wished to see should be admitted.
Here the great staircase should rest the eye,
and the great hearth should blaze. On occasions
of festivity the guests, in their
wraps, should ascend by a modest staircase
in the vestibule to their disrobing rooms,
and thence descend by the grand staircase.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The kitchen being at one end of the
front part of the house, and so conveniently
accessible to the butcher, baker, and candlestick-maker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>would leave all the space
behind the house for piazzas, terraces, and
gardens, with such fountains, statuary, and
conservatories as might be within reach of
the goodman’s purse; and all where the reporter
and unwelcome caller could not intrude;
for they would be secluded alike
from the general public and the ordinary
domestic offices. The principal apartments
of all Japanese houses, I may observe, are
at the back of the house, looking out upon
the garden with its lilies, irises, pæonias,
azaleas, its foliage plants and flowering
shrubs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus you perceive my ideal house
requires four staircases: the great one in
the great hall, the modest one in the vestibule,
the secret one (to escape creditors),
and the one for the servants.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I consider that this is only two
more than all civilized houses have, I am
surprised at the moderation and restraint of
the average house-builder. But pray remember
I am anxious to avoid that committee
of lunacy; and I have not yet begun
to build.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Personally, I entertain the highest regard
for my versatile friend’s ideal. Were I to
suggest any change in the main points, so
admirably conceived, it would be to have
the study removed to a still serener sphere,
as has already been suggested. Even with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>my friend’s excellent barricade, still, on
<i>some</i> occasion when least expected—perchance
a most momentous one, just as a
long-lost conceit had winged its return—the
dreaded intruder might force an entrance,
and put the thought to instantaneous and
irremeable flight.</p>

<p class='c001'>The size of the study, methinks, should
be small rather than large; yet ample enough
to harbor the cheering grate-fire, the easy-chairs,
the center-table, the writing-desk,
the well-filled book-cases, and the artistic
glass cabinet or cabinets, for such precious
works as should be kept under lock and
key and never loaned, or even touched by
sacrilegious hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let these gems be worthily set as becomes
their quality and rarity, so they may
minister to the delight of the eye and the
pleasure of the touch as they contribute to
the delectation of the mind. “Sashes of
gold for old saints, golden bindings for old
writings,” Nodier expresses it; and Charles
Asselineau affectionately exclaims: “My
Books, I love them! I have sought them,
gathered them, searched for them; I have
had them habited to the best of my ability
by the best tailors of books.” My glass
cabinet is my casket, my jewel-case; and
in the many-colored morocco of the bindings
that reflect the precious riches contained
within them, I see all manner of jewels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>flash and glow. In these, and in some
of the superb marblings employed in the
finer French bindings—and here the exquisite
beauty of the perfect half-morocco binding
is apparent—I derive a satisfaction akin
to that I receive from the contemplation of
any fine art object. The airy conceits and
felicities of phrase of a favorite author become
yet more entrancing when held by
these colored butterfly-wings and variegated
plumes dreamed out by the artist, and
stamped in permanent form by the skill of
the binder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thought is inclined to wander amid the
freedom of a large room. But though the
study should not be a vast apartment, it
should be sufficiently spacious for comfort
and to avoid overcrowding. Sufficiently
large it should also be and the ceiling sufficiently
high to insure a pure atmosphere.
On account of ventilation, a fire-place is of
great advantage in the room where one is
engaged in sedentary pursuits. It is the
next thing to the walk and the elixir of the
open air. De Quincey worked in a room
seventeen by twelve, and not more than
seven and a half feet high. The low ceilings
must have oppressed him; and the
vitiated air and sense of suffocation, it is
not unlikely, led him to yield to the dangerous
stimulus that inspired the Confessions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most wisely has Leigh Hunt discoursed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>upon the study and its surroundings in that
ever-pleasing essay, My Books. “I do not
like this fine large study. I like elegance.
I like room to breathe in, and even walk
about, when I want to breathe and walk
about. I like a great library next my study;
but for the study itself give me a small,
snug place, almost entirely walled with
books. There should be only one window
in it looking on trees.... I dislike a grand
library to study in. I mean an immense
apartment with books all in museum order,
especially wire-safed. I say nothing against
the museum itself, or public libraries....
A grand private library, which the master
of the house also makes his study, never
looks to me like a real place of books, much
less of authorship. I can not take kindly to
it. It is certainly not out of envy; for three
parts of the books are generally trash, and I
can seldom think of the rest and the proprietor
together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To be attractive and cozy, the study
need not be extravagantly furnished. As
in other apartments of the house, light is
one of its first requisites; with color, ease,
quiet, and, if possible, a pleasant prospect.
In the study, above all, no discordant elements
should intrude. The general tone
of the walls, decorations, and furnishings,
while rich, should yet be subdued and restful.
A glaring placque, a staring figure in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the wall or carpet pattern, or any subject
unpleasing in its nature or sentiment,
whether in paintings, pictures, or ornaments,
has no place in an apartment
which, by its very atmosphere, should conduce
to reverie and a contemplative frame
of mind. Let dreamful landscapes, rather
than figures in action, adorn and complement
the rich slate or sage of its walls and
hangings; and I picture my ideal study,
when my second ship comes in, hung round
about solely with Daubigny’s tender twilights
and peaceful river-reaches on his calm
and slowly gliding Oise.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the closer concentration of thought,
the working-chair would be placed in the
most attractive corner of the apartment,
back of the spacious writing-desk, with its
amplitude of drawers and pigeon-holes;
its topmost shelf and other convenient
places so arranged with pictures and portraits
of favorite authors and dear or absent
friends as to create and constantly diffuse
an atmosphere of congenial companionship.</p>

<p class='c001'>A carved book-rest should hold the dictionary
in place close to the working-chair,
and a revolving case within arm’s reach
should bring to it desired works of reference
and such especially treasured volumes
from which ideas may be collected—another
name for inspiration. I would mention
some of these—each worthy of crushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>levant covers, the handicraft of a Padeloup
or Payne—but for the fact that every one
should choose such inspirations for himself.
One may not be guided by another’s choice
in a face or book that charms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once during the day, but always unperceived,
save for an added freshness pervading
the apartment, my study should respond
to the touch of gentle fingers. Then, as I
mount the secret staircase when I would
be alone—a lingering aroma of violets and
the vanishing rustle of a silken robe.</p>

THERE is a sigh in the passing
breeze as the autumn days steal
on—a sigh for the summer fled.
I hear the change, the admonitory
whisper of the leaves, almost
ere the transition becomes perceptible,
for Nature as yet has scarcely altered her
outward garb.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet daily the shadows lengthen, the haze
deepens, mellower grow the evening skies,
until, no longer vacillating between summer
and autumn, the first frost smites the low-lands,
and the division line of the seasons is
visibly proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We hope in the spring, only to regret
in the fall.” But shall I regret the vanished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>summer? Will not yonder hillside glow
as all the summer meadows have never
glowed? these yellowing woods outshine
the sunshine of spring? Suddenly, through
my windows, I note where the first fires
have begun to burn. I watch the flames
creep stealthily along the hills, smoldering,
perchance, in a distant hollow, anon riding
the higher crests, illuming sumac-sentineled
ravines, invading the brier patches,
and lighting sproutland and swamp with
living fire. High on the uplands the splendor
hangs, low in the valleys the glory falls.
Steeped and flooded with its color, the landscape
gleams like an opal beneath the autumn
sun. What poet, what prose painter,
what cunning artificer of phrase can depict
the tidal wave of beauty of the latter year?</p>

<p class='c001'>Shall I regret the summer with the October
carnival at hand, when the woodcock
whistles from the alder thicket and
the grouse bursts through the painted covert?
It is for this the sportsman has longed
and waited during the lingering months of
summer. Stanchly as he is drawn upon
the covey, I am sure The Spanish Pointer,
in the old print above the writing-desk, feels
the advent of the season, and thinks, with
the latter-day philosopher, that “the preacher
who declared that all is vanity, never
looked at a fall woodcock over the rib of a
good gun.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Always on his point on the knoll, the
pointer’s riveted attitude now has an added
meaning. His eye still fixed upon the
quarry, he nevertheless moves unceasingly
in his frame. There is no deception, no
optical illusion; he <i>moves</i>—not forward or
backward, but with an oscillating, sideward
motion, as if the constant strain on his
powerful tendons had caused them to relax.
Rigid as a statue has he stood throughout
the summer, the blue blood of generations
of pointers holding him unflinchingly upon
the game. Perhaps now the scent has
grown cold. Or has he wearied of waiting
for the volley of the barrels, and, looking
up for a moment at the crimsoning copse,
bethought him that a fresh season has
dawned, and there are fresh coveys to
spring? The grim lion by Barye, in the
etching that hangs above him, remains motionless.
Though you would dread to meet
the beast of prey on the desert where he is
stalking, he shows no signs of animation
on the wall whence he looks down upon
you. Only the old pointer moves unceasingly
in his frame. Is the movement of the
picture due to the furnace heat behind the
partition wall? To you, perhaps. To me
he is plainly motioning to the covers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Methinks, also, that my good Irish terrier,
who is often by my side, looks up
at the fox’s pelt more intently as autumn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>draws on apace. The fox may suggest the
covers and its denizens to him, as the motion
of the pointer suggests them to me—the
fleet forms that haunt their mazy fastnesses,
the hares and rabbits and vanishing
shadows his steel sinews are eager to pursue.
Surely his sharply pointed ears, his
quivering muscles, and his glittering hazel
eyes are in sympathy with the movements
of the pointer, and second his invitation to
the woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Musing upon the ancient print, with its
rolling background of hill and dale, I sometimes
picture the scene of desolation which
would ensue were the woods and waters
stripped of their native tenants—the game
which is at once their glory and their joy.
Fancy the landscape denuded of the wild
life that is as indigenous as its flora, that is
nurtured upon its mast, and derives sustenance
from the very twigs and leaves of its
vegetation. Conceive, if it be possible,
streams with no trout to people their pools
and shallows, waters that never mirrored
the wood-drake’s mail, and lakes unruffled
by the web of wild fowl.</p>

<p class='c001'>Imagine the woodlands with no grouse
to beat the reveille of spring, no hares to
thread their shaded labyrinths, no fox to
prowl through their coverts. Silence the
scream of the hawk, and the voice of
the owl, crow, and jay, and instantly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>landscape would be deprived of half its
beauty, its innate beauty of sound. Game
is the essence of the woods and free, uncivilized
Nature—the division line that separates
the wild from the tame—and he
whose nerves have never tingled at the
electric whir of a game-bird’s wing and the
responsive boom of the double-barrel, has
remained insensible to one of the most inspiring
exhilarations of the senses. Just as
the library refreshes and stimulates the
mind, so do the woods, the streams, and
the stubbles become a field of health for the
body, and by the invigorating and elevating
recreation they yield do field sports serve
to strengthen both mind and body. Enough
for me that autumn is here; I must accept
the invitation of the old pointer, and examine
for myself what the woods have in
store.</p>

<p class='c001'>Brilliant as they are in the flush of their
October splendor, they will lose but little
of their beauty as autumn wanes. The
bare trees extend and expand the landscape
for me, contributing enchantments of distance
that only denuded vegetation may
reveal. Then, with the weather in a gracious
mood, I obtain effects that the green
entanglement of summer never knew. The
purple bloom upon my hills is never half so
exquisite as when a thaw has freed them
temporarily from their coverlet of snow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>disclosing their russet slopes and leafless
trees. A new palette of color is presented
in these subtle gradations of umber and
ochre, of drab and of bronze, that drape the
withered stubbles. Sere and faded in the
latter year, the lonely marsh is yet glorious
with subdued hues when touched by the
afternoon splendor. The hush which broods
upon the landscape, too, has a charm of its
own, in harmony with the quiet tones of
the slumbering woods. The very lisp of
the chickadee and solemn tap of the nut-hatch
only intensify the repose of Nature;
and I question if the combined glories of the
midsummer twilight, when the bat and
night-hawk raced upon the evening sky,
yielded anything so radiantly beautiful as
the slant November sunlight streaming
through the trees of the lowland, its vivid
crimsons reflected in the pools below.</p>

<p class='c001'>The airy spray of the beech I may admire
only during winter, and only when it
stands divested of its summer garniture
may I behold the marvelous framework of
the elm. Attractive as it is when robed in
the bloom and leafage of summer, the thorn
develops a new beauty in its gnarled and
naked branches and the hoariness of its gray
antiquity. Loveliest, too, are the birch and
hemlock in midwinter; whilst the swamp,
ablaze with the scarlet fruit of the <i>Prinos</i>
and smooth winterberry, presents its most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>vivid life above the snow. From it, likewise,
I catch the gleam of the golden willow, with
purple rufous lights that smolder amid the
twigs and branchlets of the shrubs which
seek its cool and solitude. Again, when
the snow comes sifting down from the pallid
sky, what magical effects do I not obtain
amid the dark mysterious depths of the
hemlock woods! Even then my hills and
woods offer a glorious excuse for an outing.
For have I not long pictured in imagination
the shadowy vistas where I know the big
white hares are in waiting?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is worth scaling a dozen hillsides to
breathe such air and obtain such views.
No play of sunlight on an English South
Down could be finer, and no lines of beauty
fairer than those revealed by distant table-land
and wide-extending vale. A silence,
broken only by the roar of far-off railroad
trains or the ring of the woodsman’s axe,
rests like a benediction over all, a sleep of
Nature—peaceful, deep, profound.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within the shelter of the wood, beneath
the refuge of the evergreens and undergrowth,
it is warm; without, the gale may
rave, and, above, the tree-tops wail a requiem
for the departing year; but here below it is
protected as within the walls of a building.
On either hand extend the green arcades of
the hemlocks, like the nave and transepts
of a cathedral. The downy woodpecker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and titmouse are here, ever present as choristers;
the wild life of the woods is here,
the companionship of bird and beast and
dormant vegetable life. There is life beating
beneath the mold, beneath the snowy
mantle—the ermine with which Nature
keeps her treasures warm. There is life—nimble,
fleet, and stirring—above the tell-tale
snow.</p>

<p class='c001'>That is a fox’s track leading to his den
on the hillside, the return trail of Reynard
whose sortie toward the barn-yards you
previously noticed. When he started on
his foray his pace was a walk, as his footsteps
close together reveal. Warily he was
proceeding under cover of the darkness,
planning the best means of ingress to his
gallinaceous goal. All the caution of a
skilled general on the eve of a decisive battle
is apparent in his skulking foot-prints.
His dreaded enemies are well known.
Only yesterday the hounds were hot in his
pursuit, and the echoes reverberated with
the volley of barbarous vulpicides, which
happily fell wide of its mark. But he will
outwit them all! His trained cunning has
taught him the danger of traps and gins;
his fleet foot has long borne him through
many a loop-hole of escape. The stork’s
invitation to dine must needs be deftly perfumed
and framed on an unusually tempting
card to induce him to take his claret out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>long-necked <i>carafes</i> or his <i>pâté de foie gras</i>
from metal tureens.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tracks leading back from the farmyard
show him to have been jogging along
at a more rapid gait. The prints are the
same, except that they are farther apart,
one following directly behind the other,
Indian filewise, in an almost straight line.
His object accomplished, there was no
further need of extreme caution or dalliance.
From a safe distance he had watched the
lights in the farm-house till one by one
they were extinguished, had waited until
all was silent, and his keen scent apprised
him that danger was past. It was then an
easy matter to pounce upon and bear off
the unsuspecting prey. Along his return
trail there are feathers strewed here and
there, attesting conclusively that his raid
was successful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lightly he tripped along with elevated
brush, the booty slung over his shoulder,
to the safeguard of his den. Obviously before
reaching his haven he has been startled
by something. The tracks, still in a straight
line, become much farther apart; the trot
has given place to a canter for a few rods,
when his former gait is resumed. The
baying of a hound, perchance, from his
kennel on the farther hillside, or the bark
of a fellow-vulpine freebooter, has quickened
his pace for the moment. Where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>struck into a gallop the prints of his nails
are visible; these do not show when he
progresses on his customary trot or walk,
so well are his feet protected for extended
predations by the thick fur padding between
the toes. His long sweeping brush never
once touched the snow, burdened though
he was by his plunder. This he carries
well up, knowing the increased weight it
would engender should he get it wet. A
cat is not more careful of her dainty feet
than is sly Reynard of his precious tail.</p>

<p class='c001'>In general, a fox that has acquired a
taste for poultry is considered rather an undesirable
subject for the chase proper. A
poultry fox always makes his headquarters
near the farmsteads. His daily beat, therefore,
is limited as to distance compared
with his brethren who subsist by foraging
in the woods, and whose nightly rounds
embrace a very much larger territory. Usually
a poultry fox, if started, does not take
a straight line very far, but, after leading a
short distance, commences to circle, coming
round to the place of starting after the manner
of the hare. A fox who subsists on
game knows all the fat covers of the neighborhood
where the most game lies. His
extended tramps give him wind, fleetness,
and endurance, while his familiarity with
every rod of the covers stands him in excellent
stead when hotly pursued.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>A round glittering eyeball, bright as a
coal of fire, is scrutinizing you from beneath
a pile of brushwood at the edge of the
cover. Scarcely is the gun discharged ere
a small covey of quail spring close at hand.
Investigation is needless to reveal the baffled
assassin; the tell-tale tracks upon the
snow, round like those of a fox, but smaller,
and the distance between considerably less,
divulge the nature of the trespasser. It is
none other than a cat, the petted tabby of
the farmstead, that spends a large portion
of its time in stalking game—a poacher
scarcely less destructive than its fierce wild
congener. When once a taste for game has
been formed, pursuit is thenceforward continual
and relentless, till the offender usually
ends by adopting a permanent woodland
abode, where it thrives lustily, increasing
in size and acquiring a heavy coat of fur.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look at this much-traveled esplanade,
where the tracks show so thickly upon the
snow. Overnight the hares and rabbits
have been browsing upon the young beech,
maple, and hemlock buds, with an occasional
sally into the brier patches. The
numerous trails indicate they have availed
themselves of the bright moonlight to continue
their feeding longer than usual. On
moonlight nights the <i>Leporidæ</i> always travel
most; on cold, blustering nights they seldom
leave their forms. Birds and animals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>dislike to venture out during stormy weather
unless impelled by hunger. At such times
a wood throbbing with animate life seems
entirely deserted by its furred and feathered
population. Vainly, then, the pointer or
setter may quarter the ground; the game
lies concealed and apparently scentless beneath
the brush and hiding-places, refusing
to leave its refuge unless almost stepped
upon. An apparently similar disappearance
of game is often noticeable when the weather
is fair immediately preceding a storm. The
squirrels are warmly housed in their nests
within the trees. Many of the grouse seek
shelter amid the dense hemlocks, sitting
close to the trunks on the leeside of the
storm, protected by the thick foliage and
their own matting of feathers. The closest
of beating then goes for little, so that in a
wood where you know game exists in comparative
abundance it appears a mystery
whither all its wild life has fled.</p>

<p class='c001'>The white hare and rabbit tracks—if the
smaller <i>Lepus</i> may be referred to as a rabbit—which
strew the ground are identical save
in size. There are first the marks of the
hind feet, side by side, followed by those
of the fore feet, one behind the other. Thus
it is seen the gait is always a lope or bound,
and that in springing the hare brings up
with his hind feet nearest the head, alighting,
however, on all fours at once. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>long, powerful hind-quarters seem made of
rubber sinews, the crooked stifles and great
strength of thigh acting as levers to the
supple body framed with special regard to
speed—his sole protection. In reaching for
the buds and young shoots of the undergrowth
during the deep snows, he is materially
aided by his long hind legs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the beeches the squirrels have
been busy scratching for the mast; these
appear to be the most restless foragers of
the wood, their trails being by far the most
numerous. Like the hare’s and rabbit’s,
their gait is a lope. As he lands from his
spring, the hind feet of the squirrel touch
the ground nearest the head, as in the case
of the hare and rabbit, but the two forward
feet, instead of striking one before the other,
strike nearly side by side, like a single footfall.
Occasionally, not often, he prints similarly
to the rabbit in the position of the feet,
although always smaller and somewhat less
pointed. The large blacks and grays are
persecuted by the smaller pugnacious reds,
which frequently drive them entirely out of
a wood, first pilfering their nests of the
shack they have stored.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here Master Reynard has been mousing,
seated on a stump intently watching, his
flowing brush clear of the snow; the air is
tainted with his strong odor. Where he
made a leap his footmarks are distinctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>visible amid the numerous tracks of the
field-mice—a dainty of which he is extremely
fond. Yonder is the scene of an
oft-enacted woodland tragedy, with Reynard
in his great title <i>rôle</i> of slayer. There,
beneath the shelter of an uprooted beech, a
grouse had repaired for his nightly slumber,
his head screened from the moonlight under
his protecting wings. The impress of his
form is clearly molded upon the snow.
But, alas! his now tattered plumage and a
prowling fox’s foot-prints attest his grim
awakening when his relentless foe discovered
his retreat. For this had his wings
so often rung defiance to the double-barrel;
to this ignominious end had he come at
last! Were the ghosts of murdered grouse
to haunt the scenes of their earthly sojourn,
they might rattle their featherless wings in
triumph to know that on this self-same
hillside, but a few rods from the scene of
the tragedy, Master Reynard met his fate,
a week afterward, in the jaws of clamorous
hounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>It requires a very warm day in winter
to tempt a coon from his hibernacle. To-day
his large flat prints and zigzag course
are not observable; he is snugly clad in his
fur overcoat within the fastness of a sheltering
tree. The ground-hog is sealed in his
burrow outside the wood, having “pulled
his hole in after him”; this he covers up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with leaves and earth, until, after his protracted
slumber, he emerges to view his
shadow in the spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>That was an owl which skimmed the
air so silently, on wings soft as eider-down,
noiseless as a butterfly, and stealthy as a
fox’s tread. It is not often one sees an
owl, however; in the day-time he usually
sleeps, seldom leaving his retreat till dusk,
unless during gloomy weather. The little
or screech owls are more frequently seen
by day than the larger species. With the
hawk, crow, jay, skunk, and fox, the owl
is extremely destructive to eggs and young
birds during the nesting season, large owls
not hesitating to pounce upon full-grown
hares, and sharing with the fox a great
fondness for poultry. The skunk leaves a
print similar to that of the fox and cat, barring
its reduced size. There are invariably
numbers of these threading the runways
and leading to and from the farmsteads.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a murmur like unto many voices
in the woods’ mysterious depths, as if Pan
and his train of Oreads were holding a revel
within. It is a combination of numerous
sounds that produces these ceaseless whispers
of the woods. You hear them in summer
when the insect choirs are chanting an
aërial melody and the hermit-thrush sings
as if he had a soul; you hear them in winter
when the wind sobs amid the needles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the pines, and the woodpecker’s hammer
resounds unceasingly from hollow trees;
you hear them now, on every hand, a chorus
of voices, the forest’s pulsations—a palpable
part and portion of its solitude. How weird
the cry of the blue jay, the loon of the
woods, whose startling scream sounds like
that a faun might utter in despair! His sapphire
coronet is not for you, however; he
jeers at you in strident tones from his stronghold
in the tree-tops, keeping close watch
of you, but taking care to remain well out
of range. Like his clamorous friend the
crow, he has scented F. F. F. powder before.
At intervals the airy treble of the tree-sparrow
swells the sylvan choir—a minor
but most melodious addition to the chorus.
When the powdery snow patters upon the
withered leaves and the stillness is otherwise
almost unbroken, you may hear his
carillon while he feeds on the tender buds
of the sweet birch. “A merry heart goes
all the day” is his motto and the tenor of
his blithe refrain.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are grouse tracks also that have
left their reflection in winter’s mirror—the
roving feet of the brown forest hermit, the
daintiest print upon the snow. Unless disturbed,
the ruffed-grouse will travel a great
distance on foot through the woods in quest
of food. A single bird will leave a surprising
number of tracks in the course of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>protracted wanderings, so that one is often
puzzled at the comparative scarcity of birds.
But even on the snow he is extremely difficult
to detect, so closely does he blend with
his surroundings. Not until he springs with
sonorous pinions close at your side are you
made aware of his precise location, when
you wonder you had not observed him before.
All game is alike in this respect—difficulty
of detection—even to the brilliantly
marked trout, which assume the general
color of the bottom of streams in which
they lie.</p>

<p class='c001'>Should you shoot a crow amid your
rambles, a swarm of mourners will quickly
be in attendance on the remains. Within
a few minutes every ebon inhabitant of the
neighborhood, apprised by the alarm of its
companions, may be seen winging its way
thereto with loud cawings. It can not be
the sense of sight alone that locates the
dead, for the discovery will not unfrequently
occur in thick cover or open glade.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the numerous runways of the
hares, within gunshot of which you have
taken position, extends through a glade,
affording ample opportunity to observe the
game. The eager hounds have struck the
scent leading to a form in a thicket of brier
where the quarry lies concealed. The startled
hare leaps from his covert, with the
hounds in full cry coming directly toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>you, until, turning into another runway, the
music recedes in the distance. Amid the
frenzy of pursuit two other hares have been
started, the deep baying indicating the
course of the divided pack. Round and
round the fleet hares circle, one of them
after a prolonged flight approaching your
standpoint. His agile dash for liberty has
left his pursuers in the rear, and he pauses—a
white silhouette of living beauty, and
the embodiment of nimble speed—for a
survey. He sits upon his great hind legs—his
only safeguard—turning his long clean-cut
ears forward and backward, each one
singly, to focus the sound. The music
swells into a grand <i>crescendo</i>, the twigs
crackle beneath the trampling of many feet,
and the hare is off again with the speed of
the racer. The baying of the pack indicates
the direction of pursuit, whether the game
is coming or going. A hare always circles,
returning sooner or later to the place he
started from; he never “holes,” like the
rabbit, unless in a log when exhausted. To
baffle the dogs he will sometimes imitate
his wily master, Reynard, by taking his
back track for quite a distance, and then,
leaping aside, to strike out on a fresh course;
by this means he gains a breathing-spell
and puzzles his foes.</p>

<p class='c001'>So the sport progresses, and the bag
mounts with the lengthening shadows. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>owl is sounding his lone “tu-whoo!”
when the hounds come in with lolling
tongues and trembling flanks from the prolonged
excitement of the chase. The last
hare has carmined the snow with his life-blood,
and the heavy spoils are harled and
strung. The flaming fires of sunset are
smoldering into ashen embers in the soft
southwest; the tender violets of the remote
table-lands chill to colder purples with day’s
decline; the marshaled ranks of the skeleton
trees stand out upon the hills as if limned in
India ink; the mellow hyemal twilight
deepens over woodland and valley, till the
perfect winter day merges into the moonlit
winter night and the <i>vale</i> of the sport.</p>

WHILE I make no pretense of vying
with the shops of <i>bric-à-brac</i>
and curios—it has been said the
modern house has come to resemble
a magazine of <i>bric-à-brac</i>—yet,
somehow, I find a great many objects
which would be classed under this
definition have gradually drifted or floated
in, and have become as much of an artistic
and companionable feature of the house as
the paintings on the walls. Especially since
the arrival of my ship, when several large
bales with cabalistic marks and lettering
proved on opening to be a veritable repository
of ancient Oriental workmanship and
design.</p>

<p class='c001'>I can conceive of no more hideous nightmare
than that which must haunt one who
is obliged to live in intimate companionship
with many of the so-called “ornaments”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>that dealers and the fashion of the hour force
upon one, and that, in one guise or another,
must ever be snarling and snapping at the
unfortunate possessor. Littered up with
all sorts of <i>outré</i> and unmeaning knick-knacks,
the home at once becomes a place
to flee from; and instead of the spirit of
quiet elegance and congruity which should
prevail, there reigns a pandemonium of disconformity.
Yet a certain amount of <i>bric-à-brac</i>
is not only admissible but requisite
to the decorative atmosphere of the interior.
Its effect depends upon the choosing. Given
a correct eye for color and form and a natural
feeling for harmony, Sir William Temple’s
sentence is pertinent, “The measure of
choosing well is whether a man likes what
he has chosen.” Like my paintings, rugs,
and etchings, so also my porcelains, bronzes,
arms, and armor are pleasing objects for the
eye to rest upon; and, ranged upon the
shelves and about the apartments, minister
equally in the expression and variety they
lend to the surroundings.</p>

<p class='c001'>I rejoice in my collection of arms and
armor. Many rare antiques from the Stamboul
bazaars my ship contained—lovely inlaid
Persian guns, exquisitely mounted Albanian
pistols, antique rapiers, daggers, and
swords, ancient kandjars and yataghans,
with scabbards of <i>repoussé</i> silver, of velvet,
of copper, of shagreen and Ymen leather;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>with handles of jade, agate, and ivory, constellated
with garnets, turquoises, corals,
and girasols; long, narrow, large, curved;
of all forms, of all times, of all countries;
from the Damascene blade of the Pasha, incrusted
with verses of the Koran in letters
of gold, to the coarse knife of the camel-driver.
How many Zeibecs and Arnauts,
how many beys and effendis, how many
omrahs and rajahs have not stripped their
girdles to form this precious arsenal which
would have rendered Décamps mad with
joy!<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c022'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gautier. Constantinople—Les Bazars.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>There are, moreover, glistening helmets
and coats-of-mail, corselets, maces, spears
and hauberks, battle-axes and halberds,
bucklers of tortoise-shell and Damascene
steel—all the implements of the ferocious
ingenuity of Islam. On the blue blade of
this magnificent yataghan, still keen and
glittering, its ivory handle inlaid with topaz
and turquoise, is graven the number of
heads it has severed. These cruel swords,
now crossed so peacefully, were once
crossed in savage strife and brandished in
hate upon the battle-field amid the blare of
Mussulman trumpets and the shouts of
murderous Janizaries. Often, as the sunlight
strikes the lustrous steel, do they
seem to leap into life and flash anew in remembrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of the battle-cry of Mohammed.
Though mostly of great age, my arms and
armor are all in a state of perfect preservation.
For mere antiquity in art objects or
curios is not desirable in itself. Age has its
charms unquestionably, but it becomes a
valuable factor only when accompanied by
beauty. Where an object loses its pristine
beauty through time, age is a detriment
rather than a desideratum. With many
classes of art objects time heightens their
attraction, or at least does not detract from
it. In all such, age is a desirable quantity.
To be old is generally to be rare; but an
object may be rare and still be undesirable.
Objects that are extremely sensitive to
wear are usually worthless when old.
Others, like tapestries and Oriental textiles,
are improved by use, and gain in richness
and value through age. An ancient textile
or article of <i>bric-à-brac</i> is only desirable
when, added to intrinsic beauty of texture,
color, form, or design, it preserves its
youth in its antiquity, or acquires additional
attractiveness through time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, my ship contained many fine
stuffs and hangings—old Flemish, French,
and Italian tapestries, embroideries from
Broussa and Salonica, Spanish brocades,
and brocades from Borhampor and Ahmedabad,
with some priceless ancient altar
cloths, chasubles, and dalmaticas I had long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>desired to possess. Yet with all these and
other acquisitions, now that the bloom of
first possession is brushed off, may I declare
without prevarication that I am fully
satisfied? Increase of appetite but grows
on what it feeds. Collecting begets collecting,
the desire for possession constantly
increasing, ever goading one on to unrest
in the quest of the unprocurable. How
much one misses with a little knowledge,
and how much one gains! The love for
beauty too often proves a bane. Even a
love for books is as dangerous as a love
for <i>bric-à-brac</i> or art objects—the book in
the end becoming an art object. Gradually,
from the ordinary editions one passes
to the good editions, while from the good
it is but a step to the rare, and the seething
maelstrom of book-madness. My ship
brought me many of my decorations; my
books, with few exceptions, I must procure
myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>But though sometimes productive of regrets,
no one should be without a hobby,
or hobbies. “Have not the wisest of men
in all ages, not excepting Solomon himself—have
they not had their hobby-horses?”
asks Sterne. “The man without a hobby
may be a good citizen and an honest fellow,”
observes George Dawson, in his altogether
lovely volume, The Pleasures of
Angling, “but he can have but few golden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>threads running through the web or woof
of his monotonous existence.” A hobby is
the best of preceptors, and rides straight to
the mark. From a good collection of porcelains
one may study the Chinese dynasties,
and prepare himself for an Asiatic tour
by a study of his rugs. Unconsciously the
collector of arms and armor becomes a
student of the history of numerous peoples
and an eye-witness of many of the noted
battles of the world. Were I desirous to
thoroughly familiarize myself with the history
of the American red man I should first
proceed to collect Indian implements of the
chase and war, supplementing these by
close study in the fertile field of literature
pertaining to the Indians. But my bows
and arrows I should shoot first; they would
be the guide to the target.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the essays of Elia has demonstrated
the fallacy of the adage “enough is
as good as a feast.” In decorations it were
a scant feast without the endless form and
color supplied by the potter’s art. Of all
art objects, a truly fine piece of old porcelain
is amongst the most beautiful. In color
it may outshine a precious stone; in
form, rival that of a beautiful object of Nature
herself. Its very frailty and frangibility
intensify its charm, and when possessing
both grace of contour and enchantment of
color it becomes an object of beauty by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>canons of the most perfect art, exciting the
profoundest and purest pleasure—profound
pleasure to all who behold it, supreme
pleasure to him who possesses it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I speak of the finer examples of Oriental
ceramics, though I grant there is much to
admire in some of the Italian soft-paste porcelains,
notably the lovely Capo di Monte
productions of the first period and the fascinating
Doccia <i>terraglias</i>. Royal Worcester,
despite its finish, always looks new,
and Sèvres wares I invariably associate
with a gilded French <i>salon</i> and crimson
brocatelle. These may be of excellent design
and highly wrought decoration, representing
infinite labor, skill, and minutiæ
of detail; but they seldom seem effective
compared with the handiwork of the Oriental.
For the most part European ceramics
may not be included under Prof. Grant
Allen’s term, “decorative decoration.”
Among Oriental porcelains, it is well
known that articles produced to-day may
not be compared with the same class produced
in the past. The secret of the marvelous
old glazes has been lost, like the
secret of the famed old Toledo blades, and
the craft of the ancient metal workers. It
is the remote Celestial we admire and revere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apparently, my ship must have touched
some of the out-of-the-way ports of Holland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>that paradise of blue and white, for
her collection of ceramics was rich in this
form of Oriental porcelains. It has been
asserted that the love for blue and white is
a fashion, a craze that can not endure. But
fine blue and white from its very nature is
beyond the caprice of fashion, and must be
enduring for all time. What other blending
approximates so closely to Nature? It
is but a Celestial reflex of the firmament—the
most beautiful of all sky formations, the
summer <i>cumulus</i> cloud. A coolness of
color it has possessed by no other form of
porcelain unless by the incomparable old
solid blue and blue-green enamels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not that my ship’s stores were limited
to the blue and white so lavishly distributed
among the appreciative Dutch burghers by
the fleets of a former day. There were
also many <i>chrysanthema</i> that could only
have been gathered from the classic gardens
of the Celestial himself—specimens from
the periods of Wan-li, Kia-tsing, Ching-te,
Ching-hoa, Siouen-te, and yet still earlier
rulers of the great dynasty of the Mings; diaphanous
egg-shells of the reign of Yong-tching;
Kien-long glazes fabricated in
imitation of the color and texture of old
bronzes; delicate sea-green <i>céladons</i>; solid
deep iridescent reds; and frail translucent
white pastes—marvels of the furnaces of the
past. It would require a Jacquemart or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Dana to describe them. However alien
races may regard the Mongolian and his
flowing pigtail, there can be but one opinion
of the forms and colors crystallized in
these his airy inspirations. Matchless stands
the ancient Chinese potter’s art. The world
might find a substitute for his tea; his finer
vases, jars, and bottles, and his fantasies
in storks and dragons are unique this side
of paradise. From the ordinary blue of
Nankin to the “blue of the head of Buddha,”
the “blue of heaven,” the “blue of
the sky after rain,” the “lapis lazuli,” and
the priceless “turquoise,” my blue porcelains
are a study of the clouds and the sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Blue! “the life of heaven,” the hue of
ocean, the violet’s joy; type of faith and
fidelity, it has remained for the almond-eyed
molder of clay to render thy beauty
tangible. When I admire the hues of a
Chinese vase or bottle, I remember that
each color is regarded as a symbol; the
fundamental colors being five, and corresponding
to the elements (water, fire,
wood, metals, earth), and to the cardinal
points of the compass. Red belongs to
fire, and corresponds to the south; black
to water and the north; green to wood
and the east; white to metal and the west.
Dark blue corresponds to the sky, and yellow
to the earth; blue belongs to the east.
Blue is combined with white, red with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>black, and dark blue with yellow. The
dragon, which in the Chinese zodiac corresponds
to our <i>Aries</i>, also personifies water,
while a circle personifies fire.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c022'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the bloom of the peach my ship
contained no example, so factitious a value
has been set upon this color by pretended
connoisseurs. In place of the peach-blow,
I found gleaming among my ceramics a
much more beautiful form of opalescent
porcelain—two vases of the extremely rare
“topaz,” brilliant as the gem itself, and of
which these are unique examples. Did I
say my rugs supplied the rarest colors?
I had forgotten my old bottle of <i>bleu
de ciel</i> and my ancient vase of <i>sang de
bœuf</i>!</p>

<p class='c001'>The bronzes my ship contained differed
essentially from the generality of those I
had previously known. Apart from a few
fine specimens enriched with gold and silver,
and a superb figure of Buddha, they
consisted for the most part of a singularly
beautiful collection of ancient tripods, temple-censers
and incense-burners, with dark
patine and antique-green surfaces, and engraved
ornamentation and ornamentation in
relief. The largest incense urn occupies a
prominent place in the hall, and often curls
its fragrant clouds through the mouth of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>dragon. I light it when I read A Kempis
and the Religio Medici.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the stores of my ship would have
been incomplete without an old hall-clock
that marks the time for me. An old Dutch
inlaid hall-clock of all clocks for symmetry,
beauty, and sonority! It measures rather
than accelerates the flight of the hours; and
with its quarter chimes, its deep hour-bells,
its moons, and its calendars, it punctuates
not only the moments and the hours, but
chronicles the passage of the months and
the years. I need not consult a watch for
the time, or a calendar for the day of the
month and the phases of the moon—the
musical voice and the index-fingers of my
clock proclaim them for me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among my most valued curios is a
superb violoncello. A glance shows that
it has been long and tenderly caressed by
the virtuoso who once possessed it and
developed its melodious voice. Even its
ancient case and the green baize of the lining
attest the care it has received. Scarcely
a scratch is visible on the lustrous wood,
and its curves are as harmoniously proportioned
as those of a Hebe. There is a rich,
mellow tone to the wood, and the bow
draws tones no less rich and mellow from
its deep caverns of sound. Though there
are no traces of the maker’s name or the
date of manufacture, the lovely glaze of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>spruce top and maple back at once proclaim
its antiquity. Beneath the strings
the rosin has left a fine mahogany stain;
and there are worn spots on the hoops
where it has been pressed by a loving
knee. The grain of the top is as straight
as if it had been molded. At the base
of the gracefully turned scroll, in old
English script, is carved an “H,” its only
mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>I find the same difference between a
violin and a violoncello as there exists between
a piano and an organ. The difference
of tone between individual violoncellos
is, if anything, more marked than in most
other musical instruments. There could be
nothing more sonorous and more delicately
shaded than the magnificent baritone of my
old violoncello as it interprets the Cavatine
by Raff, or chants the Andante by Mozart.
Sometimes, methinks, it gives forth a still
richer consonance when it renders Stradella’s
grave Kirchen-Arïe; or, indeed,
whenever noble church music of any kind
is drawn from its resonant depths. Then
its voice seems almost human, and the
strings quiver apparently of their own accord.
Is it fancy, after all? Are not its
strings sometimes swept by unseen fingers—the
tender touch of The Warden of
Barchester, good old Septimus Harding—who
possessed it in years gone by; who so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>often found solace in its companionship
from the tyranny of the archdeacon and the
bickerings of Barchester Close! I almost
find myself, like the warden, passing an
imaginary bow over an imaginary viol
when annoyed or harassed away from
home, so strong is its personality and so
soothing its companionship.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c022'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Trollope has
never been sufficiently appreciated, it appears
to me; and among his best works is
his simplest one. The character of the
warden, so exemplary and yet so vacillating,
the old men of the hospital who love
him so tenderly, the crafty and worldly
archdeacon, and, withal, the mellow ecclesiastical
light that pervades the churchly
precincts of the Close, form a picture
beautiful in its quiet coloring and simplicity.
It is far less a novel than an idyl, and
as such it should be read and must be regarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Music and flowers! The one suggests
and complements the other. The home
should never be without either—they are
its brightest sunshine, next to lovely woman’s
smile and the laughter of a child.
Averaged throughout the year, a dollar a
week is a modest, reasonable outlay for a
man of limited means to expend for the luxury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of flowers in the house. Every petal
holds a beautiful thought, so long as the
flower is beautiful and the petals are fresh.

TO-DAY a slaty sky, accompanied
by vaporous clouds throughout
the afternoon, is succeeded by a
pale sunset, a vivid primrose
band extending far, and lingering
late along the southern horizon.</p>

<p class='c001'>I hear an angry wind at night, first
tongued by the distant trees. Rising close
to the edge of the river, the copse catches
the least breath of the west, transmitting its
voice through the trees. Each tree thus
becomes a harp or viol played upon by the
air in motion, producing a varied music
according to the character of its spray.
How different the sound of the summer
wind! the whispering and rustling of
trillions of living leaves; one might distinguish
the season by the sense of hearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>alone. Now that vegetation is devoid of
foliage, there is so much less to obstruct the
current of the air brought pure and undefiled
from the Western plains. This air,
additionally sifted and clarified by its passage
through countless woods and primeval
forests, I inhale in full draughts within my
comfortable room. Gathered by the cold
air-boxes, this oxygen and nitrogen is tempered
and warmed by a single pound of
steam below, before rising fresh and delicious
through the registers above. Thus
even in midwinter do I receive the essence
of the meadows and the woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not less comfort and delight do I owe
to glass than to coal. It retains the heat
and excludes the frost. Scarcely the space
of a foot separates my easy chair and summer
warmth from falling flakes and wintry
cold. It lets in the balm of the sky and the
grace of the leafless trees; it serves to simulate
summer. Transparent to light and
to outward forms, glass is merely translucent
to sounds. I look out and see the
trees rock and toss beneath the gale; I listen,
and hear the wind rejoicing in his
strength. Light and sunshine stream
through my window-pane as though it
were a part of the atmosphere. It is almost
like the atmosphere—transparent, invisible,
inodorous. No material used in the construction
of the house imparts such an air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of richness from without as polished plate-glass.
Is it not equally desirable within,
to look out through? Let the carpets, if
necessary, have less depth of pile; but let
in the landscape and the light as clearly
as we may. To look at exterior objects
through vitreous waves is to cheat the
sight and rob pleasant surroundings of their
charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the glass that brings the landscape
into my room shuts out the external
world as readily as it lets it in—in the form
of stained glass it passes from transparent
to translucent, but still retains its life
through color. I would have in my hall
above the landing a wheel-window of
ancient stained glass to render daylight
doubly beautiful and refined—a flood of
violet like that concentrated and diffused
by the windows of the tall clere-story of
Tours. But the gorgeous stained glass of
mediæval days, such as still blazes in the
old cathedrals, is an art of the past, and
my ship contained it not amid her precious
stores.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet once more is glass transformed, and
from transparent and translucent is changed
to opaque—opaque, yet not opaque. Neither
clear nor colored, it possesses still more
life in this its other form. For my mirrors
not only receive light and color, but stamp
them indelibly upon their surface. Placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>in certain positions, they even enable me to
see through opaque surfaces. By a glance
into the hall through the door of the room
where I sit I may discern what transpires in
the adjoining room, though divided from
it by a solid wall. Without my mirrors I
could not even recognize my outward self.
They double the objects in my house; they
double the number of my guests; they possess
a double life. They take the place of
a Daubigny, for do they not reflect the Daubigny?
And lovely woman, how could
she look so sweet without her second self—her
mirror!</p>

<p class='c001'>The primroses in my garden are harbingers
of spring; the primrose band in the
south was the precursor of storm. All
night the wind raved, bringing snow and
still more wind with returning day. The
weather-cock creaks ominously in its socket,
pointing alternately west and northwest. I
note a drop of twenty degrees in the temperature,
and hereafter I shall distrust the
primrose band.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again the strange light in the south,
shining brightly throughout the afternoon.
This band appears most vividly through a
vista of the grounds which focuses a distant
slope crowned with deciduous trees and
isolated pines. I notice it, at times, during
late autumn and early spring, or on
mild winter days when the moisture of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>atmosphere may be perceptibly felt. The
weather-vane always points to it, though
no air be stirring—indeed, it only occurs
during a calm. Glowing through the skeleton
trees, a lustrous primrose or lively crocus,
it illumines and transfigures the entire
horizon of the south, as if inviting to follow
it to a blander clime. It seems almost
more beautiful than sunlight; it is colored
sunlight screened from glare. When
I attempt to trace it to the range of the
southern hills it keeps receding to the hills
and trees beyond—always present, ever out
of reach. An observer standing there, in
turn, would see it farther on, and these farther
hills and trees would yield its luminousness
to the landscape more southward
still.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it typical of life—man grasping at an
object only to see it disappear, seizing a
pleasure to find it evanescent, relinquishing
a hope for one yet more ephemeral; ever
reaching for happiness to meet with disappointment
at the goal?</p>

<p class='c001'>Whence its origin? in what distant sky
does it first appear? The swift wings of
the hawk might trace it to its source; for
me it is intangible. Doubtless with a word
the meteorologists would dispel the charm
it holds. I prefer to regard it as an occult
force, a mysterious weather-sign to flash
upon the wintry gloom and foretell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>coming storm. In the present instance it
brought yet more moisture, and was succeeded
the following day by fog and driving
mist, changing in the evening to sudden
cold and wind.</p>

<p class='c001'>A windy moonlight night, with clouds
chasing each other like crests of advancing
waves. The moon rides high in the west;
the strong wind sweeps from the west.
Æolus and all his retinue are abroad. The
hillside trees toss and boom like the sea—it
is high tide in the air. The air becomes
a sea, the clouds its surge, the trees the
shingle upon which it beats. It fascinates
like the sea! When the moon appears between
the rifts it seems stationary; when
partly concealed under a white cloud, it appears
coursing rapidly westward, while the
clouds seem traveling slowly eastward.
The moon then becomes the voyager, and
the squadrons of the sky the loiterers. Its
luminousness is but slightly masked by the
silver clouds, their translucency making
them seemingly a source of light. Every
now and then it disappears beneath a mass
of inky breakers, gilding their outer crests
ere taking its sudden plunge; it looks
as if it were dropping from the sky. Almost
immediately it reappears, so fast the
clouds are moving. Anon it dips beneath
a snowy surge, to re-emerge and sink below
a Cimmerian roller, just as a swimmer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>dives into and is lost in the surf. Meanwhile,
the wind roars like an angry sea.
This glory of the wintry night my glass
brings into my room. But the silver lining
and life of the moonlit clouds can not be
traced in written words, nor the varied
voices of the wind be rendered into musical
bars. The moon and the sun shine so that
all may see. The wind blows so that all
may hear.</p>

<p class='c001'>I hear a new creak in my neighbor’s
weather-vane amid the moaning of the
wind; or is it the repeated far-off blowing
of a horn? Twice on my going to the door
the sound suddenly ceases, to continue fitfully
on my return. I discover it is produced
merely by the side-light above my
writing-table. Do we not thus frequently
attribute ulterior motives to causes which
exist only in imagination, or whose source
originates with ourselves? Often is the
humming in our ear.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At times the small black fly upon the pane</div>
      <div class='line'>May seem the black ox of the distant plain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>How deceptive is sound! The leaf-cricket’s
chant on hot summer nights seems to proceed
from the lawn, rods away; he is singing
in the honeysuckle vine a few feet
overhead. Not unfrequently, when sitting
within doors, am I obliged to consider
whether the monotonous humming I hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>is the planing-mill far remote or the purring
of the cat—my pet Maltese, who looks
at me with her beryl-like eyes and arches
her back to be stroked. But though she
pricks up her ears when I scratch the under
surface of the table, she does not long
mistake the counterfeit for the wainscot
mouse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little sounds, like the petty annoyances
of life, are frequently the most unpleasant.
A great annoyance one meets forcibly,
knowing it to be a necessary evil that must
be put out of the way. The snake is killed
or evaded; the fly remains to harass. The
roaring of the gale, the downpour from the
sky—sounds loud and violent—are soothing
rather than the reverse; the rattling of a
window-blind is far more annoying. Who
but the man that is filing it can hear without
a shudder the filing of a saw, and who
but the katydid himself can passively endure
the katydid’s stridulation?</p>

<p class='c001'>A monotonous sound, providing it be
not a rasping sound, the ear becomes accustomed
to, and misses when it ceases.
The ticking of a clock, in itself unmusical,
is, nevertheless, soothing; you awaken
when it suddenly stops. The nocturnal
cricket’s reiterated cry is a somnolent sound—a
voice of the darkness and the dew.
The grasshoppers’ jubilant chorus sings
away the fleeting summer hour, and by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>rising and falling pulsation marks the waxing
and waning of the year. Even when
immelodious, most sounds of external Nature
are not irritating. The rattling of the
window-pane exasperates—one intuitively
anathematizes the carpenter; the angry
creaking of the boughs has a meaning, and
one accepts it as a fitting and necessary accompaniment
of the gale. The harsh barking
of a dog rouses one from slumber; it is
plainly in most cases an annoyance which
has no just reason for existence—the neighborhood
were better off without it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The railroad whistles, scarcely farther
removed and far more plainly heard, are
not annoying. At once they are accepted
by the mind as possessing a reason. For
behind the whistle are the vast driving-wheels,
the passengers, the mails, and the
merchandise. When I hear the locomotive’s
whistle I feel the locomotive’s power,
and the significance of its strength. It is
the voice of might and speed; the exultant
neigh of the great iron charger. It sounds
the hours for me. Day after day—night,
morning, and afternoon—with the same exactitude,
scarcely a minute after the engineer
has opened the sounding-valve, do the
cars, arriving and departing, pass along the
opposite shore of the river. Far off among
the distant valleys resounds the clatter of
the oncoming train; now lost for a moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>now more distinctly heard. A mile
and a half away on the still night air the
whistle sounds, and the awakened echoes
respond. I hear the roar through the gap
of the hills, the crash across the bridge, the
reverberating flight along the bank, the
gradual receding and absorption of the
sound. Nightly, expectantly, I listen for it,
and miss it when the train is late.</p>

<p class='c001'>How much does not the arrival of the
night express signify! how much of pain
or pleasure to those it bears! Friends who
have parted, and friends who are waiting;
news sad and joyous; regrets and hopes;
hatred and love; laughter and tears; all the
emotions and passions harbored in human
hearts are present in the rapid flight of the
train. The engineer at the throttle, the
fireman who supplies the fuel—calm, watchful,
serene at their posts amid the deafening
roar and jar—I think of them when the
whistle sounds, plunging onward through
the darkness and the storm.</p>

<p class='c001'>What a fascination exists in the flight of
a train—an exhilaration to those on board,
an ever-recurring marvel to those who witness
it pass by! A speck in the distance, it
momentarily enlarges till, thundering past,
it instantly recedes, as swiftly lost as it was
swift to appear. Onward it flies, annihilating
space, outspeeding time, flinging the
mile-posts behind, bearing its burden to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>remote destinations. A moment it pauses
to slake its thirst, or to deposit a portion of
its burden, replacing it with fresh freight in
waiting. Still onward it flies, linking villages
and towns, spanning streams, connecting
valleys, tunneling hills, joining
States. Ever the crash and the roar, the
great trail of smoke and steam, the engineer
at the throttle—calm, watchful, serene—plunging
through the darkness and
the storm! This the whistle means for
me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instantly I detect the whistles of the different
roads, some more musical, some
more acute, some deeper, more sonorous
in tone. Varying in resonance according
to the state of the atmosphere, they apprise
me of the temperature without, like the
audible vibration of the rails themselves
when passed over by the cars. Clear and
musical in the early summer mornings, during
cold weather they are more sibilant and
piercing. They are a weather-vane to the
ear, blown by heat or cold, responsive to
the moisture or the dryness of the air. I
observe similar acoustic effects in the tones
of the distant bells. So that I may often
prognosticate the weather as surely by external
sounds as by the shifting barometer
of the hills.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even through my windows I like to
analyze the sentiment of animate sounds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“The nature of Sounds in general,” remarks
the author of Sylva Sylvarum, “hath
been imperfectly observed; it is one of the
subtellest Peeces of Nature.” During a
ramble through the woods and fields I am
impressed by the various emotions conveyed
by bird voices alone. Through
them the woods and fields acquire an
added meaning; they are the interpreters of
Nature. Thus, the voice of the jay is a
signal to inform his companions of danger;
the scream of the hawk, a note of menace
to intimidate his prey and cause it to reveal
its whereabouts. The woodpecker’s tap is
a sound of industry. The mourning-dove’s
notes express sorrow; the hermit-thrush’s,
ecstasy; the veery’s, solitude; the white-throated
sparrow’s, content. The voices
of the bluebird and song-sparrow are
sounds of welcome, an exordium of spring.
The plaintive whistle of the wood-pewee,
the liquid warble of the purple finch, and
the refrain of many a companion songster,
it would require the fine ear and fancy of
the poet to interpret aright. Perhaps Frederick
Tennyson well defines the sentiment
they express in his melodious rendering of
the blackbird’s song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The blackbird sings along the sunny breeze</div>
      <div class='line'>His ancient song of leaves and summer boon;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich breath of hayfields streams through whispering trees;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>And birds of morning trim their bustling wings,</div>
      <div class='line'>And listen fondly, while the blackbird sings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And how deliciously one of the sweet old
Swabian singers has also voiced the blackbird
of Europe, and interpreted his rippling
strain:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Vög’le im Tannenwald pfeifet so hell—</div>
      <div class='line'>Pfeifet de Wald aus und ein, wo wird mein Schätzle sein?</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Songster in pine-wood whistleth so clear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Is it a Minnesinger? I wonder; for I can not
place the poet who hymned the feathered
minstrel so sweetly. My German friend
the professor, who improvises in music as
deftly as Heine improvised in verse, and to
whom I repeated the lines the other day,
was struck anew by their haunting melody.
Seating himself at the piano, he immediately
set them to this exquisite accompaniment.
The music has been ringing in my ears ever
since—a very echo of the songster, rising
clear and jubilant from the shade of the
wood. The words have been set to music
before, a version being included in that melodious
collection of national, student, and
hunting songs entitled Deutscher Liederschatz.
But this is commonplace compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to the rendition of my German friend.
Try it those of you who have a voice to try;
or let your sweetheart try it for you. You
will then appreciate the consummate art of
the music—the ascending scale of the second
bar felicitously phrasing the whistle of
the bird, and the falling inflection of the
third happily portraying the cool, shadowy
depths of the wood. And how like a silvery
bird note of June the upper “g” in
the seventh bar sounds the close of the
refrain!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>No poet or prosatist, however, comes
so near to the bird as the great prose-poet
of the Wiltshire Downs:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The bird upon the tree utters the
meaning of the wind—a voice of the grass
and wild flower, words of the green leaf;
they speak through that slender tone.
Sweetness of dew and rifts of sunshine, the
dark hawthorn touched with breadths of
open bud, the odor of the air, the color of
the daffodil—all that is delicious and beloved
of spring-time are expressed in his
song. Genius is nature, and his lay, like
the sap in the bough from which he sings,
rises without thought. Nor is it necessary
that it should be a song; a few short notes
in the sharp spring morning are sufficient
to stir the heart. But yesterday the least of
them all came to a bough by my window,
and in his call I heard the sweet-brier wind
rushing over the young grass.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c022'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Just what emotion the caw of the crow
conveys I am at a loss to determine, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>it be self-complacency—a harsh way of expressing
it, it would seem. His notes
sound more like anger; and in the woods
he certainly does quarrel with the owls, the
song-birds, and his own kindred. But his
apparent anger may be only feigned, and
his voice belie his real character. Assuredly,
there was never a more self-complacent
tread than the crow’s on a grain field.
The farmer and the scarecrow at once become
secondary to him, and pilfering
becomes almost a virtue, he pilfers with
such grace. His tread is as majestic as the
soaring of the hawk, and though black as
night and evil, his plumage glistens as
brightly as light and purity. He seems a
true autochthon of the soil. It is much in
the way things are done, after all; boldness
often passes for innocence, and self-confidence
begets security.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gladness, serene contentment, is most
strongly expressed to me by the bobolink,
the “okalee” of the starling, and the singular
medley of the catbird. To be sure, the
catbird frequently justifies his name, and is
anything but an agreeable songster; but to
make amends for his introductory discords
he frequently gives us a delightful palinode.
Plaintiveness, sadness over the departed
summer, is conveyed by the blackbird’s
warble fluted over fields of golden-rod; it
is expressed in the trembling notes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>yellow-bird, as he scatters the thistle’s floss
to the winds.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we would carefully analyze the speech
of external Nature, I doubt not we could
trace some well-defined sentiment in nearly
all animate sounds; assuredly in very many of
the voices of birds, animals, and insects. For
Nature’s moods and tenses are conveyed as
strongly through the tympanum of the ear
as through the retina of the eye. Their correct
interpretation depends upon our inner
sight and hearing. I am not sure that in
man’s relation to Nature the sense of hearing
does not contribute almost as much enjoyment
as the sense of seeing. Certainly,
Nature would seem but half complete without
her characteristic voices. Think of her
wrapped in the winding-sheet of eternal
silence, a mere mummy, with no song of
bird or whisper of wind to impart animation
to her scenes. Color and form are
but half the landscape; it is sound that
gives it life, and renders it companionable.
What is winter, in one sense, but absence
of sound, not merely the absence of bird
and insect voices, but the rustling of leaves
and grasses, the murmur of waters, the life
and movement of growing vegetation!</p>

<p class='c001'>Are not the first signs of spring conveyed
through sound? Ere yet a song-bird
can find an utterance, or grass-blade
impart a sense of resurrected life I hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>cracking of the ice and the gurgling of the
frost-freed rills. The crow announces the
change before the snowdrop comes, and the
wild geese proclaim it from the sky before
the sallows invite the precocious bee. No
doubt the bee is already waiting for the
flower, and winnows it into bloom; for no
sooner is the corolla ready to expand than I
hear his murmurous wings. High in the
willow catkins; low down in the horn of the
skunk-cabbage; bending the yellow bloom
of the first dog-tooth violet, his hum of industry
is heard. The bee is perhaps the first
constant spring musician, though his is not
the earliest vernal voice. The pushing daffodils
of the perennial flower-border speak to
me of spring, the choir of the toads and <i>hylodes</i>
announces it even more emphatically.</p>

<p class='c001'>How we should miss the voice of Chanticleer
were the domestic fowl to become
silent! It never occurred to me how important
a role he plays until the author of
The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter makes
him serve as a matutinal alarm to Schaunard
in lieu of the time-piece he has
pawned. And Herrick, too, in His Grange,
or Private Wealth, has the domestic fowl
serve a similar purpose:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>Though clock</div>
      <div class='line'>To tell how night draws hence, I’ve none,</div>
      <div class='line in15'>A cock</div>
      <div class='line'>I have to sing how day draws on.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>We might rise and retire, indeed, with the
clock of the cock, and at all times of day
and at all seasons we would sadly miss his
voice were he subject to laryngeal troubles.
It is a cheery and companionable sound,
the absence of which would cause an appreciable
void. Many sounds not strictly
belonging to outward Nature become complementary
to her through familiarity, or
through the surroundings amid which they
are heard. Thus the hills and valleys
speak through the roar of the railroad train,
and the harvest fields find a fitting tongue
in the thrashing machine. A domestic voice
rather than a voice of Nature, the cock’s
crow is, notwithstanding this, associated
with Nature and rural scenes. It is more a
voice of the country and a pulsation of the
rural landscape than an expression of urban
surroundings. The city hems it in; the
country expands it. Orpheus might pause
to listen to it when sounded from an autumnal
upland, it is so resonant and sonorous. So
much does the scene, or the conditions
amid which sounds are uttered, affect the
sounds themselves.</p>
<p class='c001'>As a purely wild sound of Nature—the
Nature of our own woods and fields—the
cry of the owl is, perhaps, unrivaled. The
bark of the fox has some analogy to it in
point of wildness, except that his voice is
always further removed. I hear it on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>moonlight winter nights following the undulations
of the wooded hills—a short sharp
bark thrice repeated at rather prolonged intervals.
It is an eerie sound, the cry of
the vulpine freebooter, ranging his native
woods through the frosty winter nights. I
never look up at the fox’s pelt slung across
the <i>portière</i>-rod in the smoking-room without
a feeling of regret for the lissom life that
was slain. The grand brush that steadied
him in his flight; the sharp pointed nose,
once alive to every atom of the atmosphere;
the fine soft fur, beautiful still in death,
appeal mutely to me for a life wantonly
sacrificed. I care not how many grouse
and ground-birds may have fallen victims to
his cunning—they were his rightful prey,
the spoil of his domain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The drumming of the ruffed-grouse imparts
a sense of life and companionship to
the woods such as few other sounds convey.
<i>Bonasa umbella!</i> there is a whir of
vigor in his very name. Every one should
be born a sportsman to appreciate his glorious
<i>crescendo</i>; hunting is given to man of
the gods, Xenophon rightly said. The
grouse is the woodland guide, the alcaid
who holds the keys to all its guarded recesses,
the courier who knows every lane
and passage that thread the forest depths.
Accept his invitation, and you are conducted
into hidden nooks, and presented glimpses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of sylvan beauty of whose existence you
would otherwise never have dreamed. His
roll-call is a stimulus to exercise, an excuse
to explore the covers. Onward and onward
and still onward he leads; now amid
a sun-flecked vista of tree-trunks, now
through a thicket of intertwining saplings,
now to a woodland antechamber frescoed
with October colors, now up some lofty
hillside overlooking the empurpled valley.
A taste of the bitter he also mixes with the
sweet, as when flushed for the third or
fourth time, weary of pursuit, he leads to
an almost impenetrable thicket of bramble,
perchance to skim off unseen on hearing
your approach, or to dive deep down into a
precipitous glen, only to mislead by suddenly
wheeling up the hillside in a long
deceptive flight. Most noticeably in the
spring, and frequently in the autumn, and
on tempered winter days do I hear the music
of his wings, far away in some sequestered
glade, beating a sylvan tattoo—most
picturesque of all woodland sounds; it is as
if the woods themselves were speaking.</p>

<p class='c001'>The squirrel’s bark is emphatically a sylvan
expression. He knows its effect upon
the listener, and selects a bland, sunshiny
day when he may be distinctly heard. But
only at a safe distance, for has not the fox
taught him caution, and the grouse the
wile of placing a tree-trunk between himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and the double-barrel? Were I to
analyze the sentiment of the squirrel’s bark,
I should term it an utterance of derision.
Not altogether derision, however; for besides
a snarling tone, it has a perceptible
sound of cracking and crunching, as of nuts
and acorns being husked and split by a rodent’s
tooth.</p>

<p class='c001'>An eery cry is the “ssh-p! ssh-p!” of
the twisting snipe—two fifths a whistle,
two fifths a cry, while to the nervous
sportsman the other fifth is a jeer. A guttural
cry, a strange raucous cry, a very
voice of the treacherous ooze and the rustling
sedge. It can not be put into words,
and only the snipe himself can sound it.
Most voices of the marsh are characteristic;
it has its distinctive gamut of sound. The
cheerful music of the woodlands is wanting;
its speech is pitched in a graver key,
in keeping with its solitary haunts where
Syrinx ever murmurs through her murmuring
reeds. How expressive its many-sounding
tongues—the boom of the bittern,
the harsh quack of the heron, the
scream of hawk and kildeer, the multitudinous
calls of water birds—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>cries that might</div>
      <div class='line'>Be echoes of a water-spirit’s song.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>All through the spring and autumn nights
countless wings are cleaving the upper air,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>bearing the hurrying voyagers in search of
distant climes—flocks of plover and woodcock,
skeins of snipe and shore-birds,
throngs of ducks and geese, voicing their
way through the darkness, league after
league, hour after hour on their long journey
of migration.</p>
<p class='c001'>I look for drought and heat when the
cicada shrills. The rhythm of the cricket’s
creak tells me if the night be hot or cold.
I see the gathering rain-clouds when the
tree-toad croaks and the hair-bird trills.
The bluebird warbles, “it is spring”; a
thousand throats proclaim the summer.
Sounds from the woods, sounds from the
waters, sounds from the fields, sounds from
the air! The infinite beauty of sound! Are
not Nature’s voices one of her most endearing
charms?</p>

<p class='c001'>How the gas-burner and window-pane
have led me to digress! But even from my
comfortable room it is sometimes pleasant
to look out beyond the storm and bask in
the luminousness of the primrose band.</p>

CONTRASTED with the bleakness
without, the greenhouses and
conservatory possess an additional
charm. Within their walls of
glass reigns a luxuriance of leaf
and bloom. Like the garden, however, the
greenhouse will not care for itself. Many
of the requirements necessary out of doors
I find imperative within. And yet cultivation
is on an entirely different scale, a mere
pot of earth taking the place of barrowsful
under out-of-door culture. In the garden
I simply place a plant at the requisite depth
and in the proper exposure and soil; in the
greenhouse a finer discrimination is called
for.</p>

<p class='c001'>This small plant, bulb, or fern may not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>be plunged indiscriminately into any receptacle.
I must measure the size and requirements
of the plant; and not only place it in
congenial soil, light or shade, but measure
its needs with regard to the size of its prospective
domicile. My small plants will
fail with too much nourishment, my large
plants pine with too little. Some will not
thrive in soil at all, but must be cultivated
on a block of wood, sustaining themselves
merely on air and moisture. In the garden
each plant draws from the largess of the
earth just what properties it needs for
growth and development, and the deeper
the surface soil the better the plant will
thrive. From some standpoints my greenhouses
possess an advantage over my garden;
in another sense the garden is more
satisfactory. The one is artificial, the other
natural; but the greenhouse is, possibly,
more easily controlled. With proper care
and intelligence I can count upon certain
fixed results. I am not dependent upon
the uncertain watering-pot of the sky, and
have nothing to fear from frost or violent
winds. But I must needs exert a keener
watchfulness over my charges; Nature is
no longer the warder. Just so much heat,
so much air, so much sun, so much moisture
they must have. For tender exotics,
born of a milder clime, are among my nurslings.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>My orchids, for instance. Some occur
naturally on damp rocks in a cool atmosphere;
others on trees in dense tropical
forests; still others on high elevations
where they receive much sunlight. Shade
or coolness, which certain species demand,
are injurious to others which flourish in
warmth and sunshine. The different habitats
of the species, therefore, must be carefully
studied, and the conditions under
which they thrive in nature imitated as far
as possible under glass. “A juggler,” says
the accomplished curator of the Trinity College
Botanic Gardens, “not unfrequently
keeps four balls flying over his head with
one hand, and the successful orchid-grower
has to deal quite as closely with heat, air,
light, and moisture.” My greenhouse, accordingly,
calls for its parlor and bath-room,
its smoking-room and refrigerator.</p>

<p class='c001'>I miss the breadth and sunlight of the
garden; I gain immunity from the caprice
of the elements. My glass house bridges
over the dreary interval between the last
wind-flower of autumn and the first primrose
of spring. If I can not go to the tropics,
if I can not have the summer, I can at least
recall the one and counterfeit the other.
Could I control the sunlight and inclose a
sufficient space, I should scarcely miss my
hardy flower borders.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the greenhouse I have my charges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>nearer my eye; I can watch their development
closer. Many of the insect pests that infest
the garden come to prey upon the plants
indoors. The same warfare I wage without,
I must wage within. Care and attention
are ever the price of the flower. The
insects continue to multiply. They develop
new races and people new countries. No
sooner does one scourge become extinct
than a dozen others take its place. For the
weevil we have the army-worm, the potato-bug,
the apple-tree borer, the codling-moth.
I no sooner administer a soporific to
the red spider than the aphides are at work,
and these are scarcely subjugated ere the
mealy-bug appears. Cockroaches bite the orchid
roots, mice nibble the young shoots of
the carnations. Mildew and blight likewise
destroy, and snails emerge from unsuspected
places to prey upon the succulent leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>My greenhouse gives me a bog-garden
which the altitude of the grounds precludes
without. My tank is a miniature bayou, a
cage for aquatics. It is always pleasant to
watch the growth of water plants, they
seem so appreciative of their bath; the very
fact of their growing from the water gives
them a distinct individuality. These clumps
of Egyptian papyrus and smaller variegated
<i>Cyperus</i>, emerging from the ooze, are as
beautiful as flowers. One of the easiest of
aquatics to grow, the papyrus, or great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>paper-reed, throws out strong runners beneath
the water, forming dense tufts of tall
culms, crowned with large handsome umbellate
panicles; indeed, it spreads so rapidly
that it requires to be kept vigorously in
check. The handsome variegated <i>Cyperus</i>
has a tendency to revert to the type, but
this may be prevented by cutting out the
green shoots that appear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great water-lilies, too—the <i>Nymphæas</i>
and <i>Nelumbiums</i>—are among the most
accommodating plants for water culture, as
they are unquestionably among the most
beautiful of flowers. Equally handsome
and fragrant, many of the species rival the
terrestrial lilies, and are far less fastidious.
Few, if any, of the species are more beautiful
than the common water-lily (<i>Nymphæa
odorata</i>), the white and perfumed cup that
floats upon our ponds and sluggish streams.
From my tank I may pluck its blossom
without being mired, though I miss the
kingfisher’s clarion and the sheen of the
dragon-fly’s wings with which I associate
it in Nature. I miss also the flapping of its
pads when touched by the wind, showing
the red under sides of the shields, lovely as
the flash of trout that lurk beneath. Long
must I search for a more delicious odor than
that contained within its waxen folds. Begotten
of the ooze, a stem shoots upward
to the sun and air to unfold its chalice on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>some secluded pool. The first white water-lily,
cradled on the water’s rippling breast!
it is the floral embodiment of summer. It
falls upon the sight like the tinkle of a woodland
rill upon the ear, imparting its harmony
to the mind, a thing to be carried away and
perfume the memory. I would willingly
exchange the Zanzibar species for it, if
thereby I might cause the white lily to bloom
in winter.</p>

<p class='c001'>For winter blossoming the former are
invaluable aquatics, with pink-purple and
blue flowers respectively, opening during
daylight. The deliciously scented pink-purple
variety (<i>N. Zanzibarensis rosea</i>),
almost an evergreen aquatic, is the strongest
grower, its flat leaves also being large
and of great substance. The night-blooming
<i>Nelumbiums</i>, <i>N. Devoniensis</i>, <i>rubra</i>,
and <i>dentata</i>, with pink, red, and white
flowers respectively, are the best of their
division. <i>N. speciosum</i>, the sacred lotus
of the Nile, is a beautiful summer-flowering
species with immense pink flowers; <i>N.
luteum</i> is the tall-growing yellow water-lily,
its blossoms seven to ten inches in
diameter. Balzac, in Le Lis dans la Vallée,
associates the lotus with the old Hellenic
sentiment, except that instead of the
word country he substitutes love:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cueillons la fleur du Nénuphar</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui fait oublier les amours,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the <i>Nénuphar</i> being the lotus of France,
<i>Nymphæa alba major</i>. And those of us
who do not know the lotus of the classics
are all familiar with the lotus of Tennyson,
“that enchanted stem” which whosoever
did receive and taste, forthwith obtained
rest and dreamful ease.</p>
<p class='c001'>There exists some doubt, however, as
to which lotus the old Greeks really referred
to. The question, What was “lotus”?
has been discussed intermittently for
at least two thousand years. We must
bear in mind that “lotus” was a term applied
by the Greeks to several plants or
trees. The Latin poets, and Pliny very
likely, used the term more vaguely still, not
being botanists as were some of the Greeks.
For there is also the date-plum (<i>Diospyrus
lotus</i>), a deciduous tree native of the coasts
of the Caspian Sea, and cultivated and
naturalized in Southern Europe, the fruit of
which is edible. This has been held by
some to be the lotus of the Lotophagi, or
lotus-eaters. Besides, there is the prickly
lotus shrub or jujube-tree (<i>Zizyphus lotus</i>),
indigenous to the Libyan district and portions
of Asia, to the sweet and odorous
fruit of which has been equally ascribed the
power of causing one to forget one’s home.
It is still eaten by the natives, and a wine
or mead is extracted from its juice. The
term lotus was also applied to several species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of water-lily—the Egyptian water-lily
(<i>Nymphæa lotus</i>), the blue water-lily (<i>N.
cærulea</i>), and more particularly to the <i>Nelumbium</i>
of the Nile (<i>Nelumbium speciosum</i>).
The <i>Nelumbium</i> is a native both of India
and Egypt, though almost extinct in the
latter country now; and in the ancient Hindoo
and Egyptian mythological representations
of Nature, as is well known, it was
the emblem of the great generative and
conceptive powers of the world, serving as
the head-dress of the Sphinxes and the ornament
of Isis. It was known, moreover,
as the Egyptian bean, on account of its
fruit, the cells of which contained a kind of
bean employed as an article of food. Indigenous
to China as well, the roots are still
served there in summer with ice, and laid
up with vinegar and salt for winter. Both
the fruit and the root of <i>Nymphæa lotus</i>
were likewise eaten by the ancient Egyptians;
while Horus, the divine child who
personified the rising sun, is always represented
in hieroglyphics as emerging from a
water-lotus bud.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the East, a belief in a divinity residing
in the lotus has existed from the most ancient
times, worship of this divinity of the
lotus being the dominant religion in Thibet
at the present day. The daily and hourly
prayer, Wilson states in the Abode of Snow,
is still, “<i>Om mani padme, haun</i>,” or literally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>rendered, “O God! the jewel in the lotus.
Amen.” In Cashmere the roots of the water-lotus
are pulled up from the mire and
employed as an article of diet. The root is
sweet, and was formerly used for making
an intoxicating beverage, as the sap of the
palm is still employed in some localities.
In like manner the roots of the yellow lotus
were used by the American aborigines as
an article of diet, Nuttall recording that,
boiled when fully ripe, they become as
farinaceous, agreeable, and wholesome as
the potato.</p>

<p class='c001'>Research tends to show that it is the <i>Zizyphus</i>
rather than any of the other species
of lotus to which Homer and Theophrastus
ascribed the power of causing forgetfulness.
Theophrastus and Dioscorides, Greek botanists,
both describe different kinds of lotus,
but their descriptions are not always trustworthy.
Homer mentions yet another
lotus, supposed to be <i>Melilotus officinalis</i>,
the yellow variety of sweet clover common
to this country where it has become naturalized
from Europe. It was this plant
which he describes as nourishing the steeds
of Achilles. Authorities differ so greatly,
however, that it is difficult to decide with
absolute certainty which species of lotus is
really the fabled plant of the Greeks, though
the weight of opinion would point to the
<i>Zizyphus</i> as against the <i>Diospyrus</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>especially the <i>Nelumbium</i>. The poetical
folk-lore of plants must not be expected to
be literally true. Even the observant Greek,
Aristotle, has many absurdities about plants.
So has Theophrastus, but Pliny is full of the
most ridiculous superstitions, which he relates
with all the seriousness of a firm believer
in them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In attempting to place many plants and
flowers of the ancient classic poets there is,
therefore, always more or less difficulty and
uncertainty. To identify the plants mentioned,
without studying them in the country
where those who wrote about them
lived, is fruitless when there is such a great
difference of opinion as to what the ancient
Latin poets mean by “violet” or “hyacinth,”
or “narcissus.” Sibthorp, who
was Professor of Botany at Oxford, England,
about eighty years ago and who was
a fine classical scholar, went to live three
years in Greece for the purpose of identifying
the Greek flowers and plants mentioned
by the classics. He returned with the conclusion
that it is impossible to do it satisfactorily
and he was quite certain, though
the Greek language still remains in Greece
very slightly changed, that what the modern
Greeks call a “hellebore” or a “hyacinth”
is different from the flowers that were
called by these names two thousand years
ago.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Herodotus (Book iv, p. 177) places the
geographical range of the lotus-eaters from
the recess of the Gulf of Cabes eastward to
about half-way along the coast of Tripoli,
which would correspond with Homer’s account.
The former describes the natives as
living “by eating the fruit of the lotus—the
fruit about the size of the Pistacia nut,
and in sweetness like the fruit of the date.
From this fruit the lotus-eaters made their
wine.” What Homer says regarding the
lotus is this (Odyssey, Book ix, v. 82, etc.):
Ulysses is recounting his adventures to the
guests of the King of Corfu after dinner.
He relates how he was on his way home
from Troy, and was doubling Cape St. Angelo,
when a storm from the north met his
fleet and drove it from its course. After
sailing southward for nine days, he sighted
land and made for it, as the fresh-water
supply was exhausted. The crews enjoyed
the luxury of a meal on shore, and then began
to wonder where they were. So
Ulysses chose two good men, adding a
herald with a flag of truce, a necessary precaution
in those times when strangers were
enemies, as a matter of course. These men
were to inquire who the inhabitants of the
land were. “The lotus-eaters received
them kindly and gave them lotus to eat.
As soon as they eat the honey-sweet fruit
of the lotus they would not come back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>bring me tidings, nor go away, but wished
to remain where they were with the lotus-eaters,
gathering and eating lotus and to
think no more of going home. They shed
tears when I dragged them back by force to
the ships and tied them by ropes to the
benches in the hold. Then I ordered the
rest of the crews to go on board at once,
for fear any of them should eat lotus and
think no more of going home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To believe that the Homeric legend referred
to the fruit of the jujube-tree does not
necessitate our believing that the fruit had
a sedative effect upon those who eat it.
Rumors of a people leading a lazy and indolent
life in a delightful climate and subsisting
on the fruit of trees, and rumors that
sailors accidentally landing there had given
up the dangers and hard work of a seafaring
life and deserted, would be enough to
give the foundation of the legend. There
is a story entitled The Mutiny of the Bounty,
a true history, which gave the foundation
of Byron’s tale The Island; and there
are many points of similarity between this
and Homer’s brief tale; but Ulysses, the
man of many resources, proved a better
match for his mutinous men than did Captain
Bligh.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tennyson’s lotus “laden with flower
and fruit,” which is specified as being
borne on “branches,” is evidently the <i>Zizyphus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>or else the <i>Diospyrus</i>; although
the line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The lotus blows by every winding creek</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>might lead one to suppose he referred to
the <i>Nelumbium</i>, were it not for the former
contradictory line and the fact that the water-lily
grows in the water itself. At any
rate, sufficient authority exists to render it
certain that some species of lotus yielding
an intoxicating product was regarded sacred
because of an indwelling god. But whatever
species was really referred to by the
classics as the charmed nepenthe—whether
the fruit of the jujube-tree, or merely a
fruit of the fabled garden of Hesperides, to
us the name lotus at once brings up the
gorgeous water-lily that once rocked upon
the Nile, with its grand pink blossoms and
its great green leaves. The <i>Nelumbium</i> has
taken kindly to American soil, having increased
in several marshy localities in New
Jersey with astonishing rapidity, entirely
crowding out the native growths of arrowhead,
pickerel weed, and horsetail, where
it has been placed and become established.
With its great tendency to spread and multiply,
it will soon supply the dragon-fly a
classic flower to rest upon, and the great
green frog a still more spacious paludal
throne than that hitherto supplied by the
shield of the native water-lily.</p>
<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Suspended above the tank are numerous
large plants of <i>Lælia anceps</i> and <i>L. a. morada</i>,
leaning their long lavender sprays
over the pool, like flocks of hovering butterflies.
With them are also suspended
large specimens of the staghorn and the
hare’s foot ferns. Ferns and orchids invariably
look well in combination. Palms being
somewhat stiff themselves, do not associate
so well with orchids, which need
the relief of more graceful foliage. The
hare’sfoot fern is appropriately named, the
innumerable twisting rhizomes being soft
and woolly, like the foot of a hare, and the
fronds fine and feathery. Of all the <i>Lælias</i>,
<i>L. a. morada</i> has the longest stems, and is
among the largest and finest flowered. I
grant the exquisite beauty and fragrance of
the white form. Comparatively an inexpensive
variety, the former is to be preferred
to some others quoted at from ten to twenty
times its marketable value. For in orchids,
price very frequently does not represent intrinsic
beauty of bloom; and mere rareties
or orchidaceous curiosities are preferable in
one’s neighbor’s collection. I am satisfied
with fine specimens of a few of the easier
grown and really beautiful species and varieties.
A fine plant of <i>Cypripedium œnanthum</i>
which my neighbor values at a thousand
dollars is not worth my <i>Lælia</i> to me.
Its flower is stiff in comparison, and its dorsal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>sepal, though strikingly rayed—white,
striped with pink—has not the grace and
beauty of the <i>Lælia’s</i> velvety petals and the
exquisite blossoms of many other species.
After all, may it not well be questioned
whether the hardy pink lady-slipper has a
rival among the numerous species and hybrids
of the big labellums and long-tailed
petals?</p>

<p class='c001'>My orchids, like my roses, have their
parasites—the green and yellow fly, the
black thrip, the mealy-bug, the lesser snail,
the scale. Of late years the yellow fly has
become more numerous, though, with the
green fly, the rose is his especial prey. It
is difficult to know what plan to adopt
against my insect enemies. The rule of
three will not solve the difficulty, for a
mean proportional does not exist. If my
houses are too hot or the plants too dry,
the red spider and black thrip swarm; if
too cold, the mildew comes; if the weather
be muggy, it is a summons for the green
and yellow fly. Tobacco stems placed
upon the hot-water pipes banish the black
thrip where fumigating is of no avail. Fumigating
alone will disperse the aphides.
The smaller snail I must bate with lettuce
leaves; the larger one must be searched for
at night with a lantern. For mildew I
must place sulphur and lime on the pipes,
and the scale and mealy-bug demand their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>periodical sponge-bath. The cockroach
sips treacle and is lost in the sweets.
Wood-lice come from underneath the
benches, and the lesser snail, despite all
precautions, will sometimes bite off a flower-spike
six times larger than himself. It
all reminds me of a passage in the Faerie
Queen:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A cloud of cumbrous gnats do him molest,</div>
      <div class='line'>All striving to infixe their feeble stinges,</div>
      <div class='line'>That from their noyance he no where can rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>But with his clownish hands their tender wings</div>
      <div class='line'>He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Care and attention are ever the price of the
flower.</p>
<p class='c001'>It is hardly to be wondered at that orchids
have their insects; the wonder is they
do not possess them in greater numbers,
the flowers themselves so resemble insects
and strange creatures of the air. I can
scarcely define which attracts me most, the
singular flowers or the fantastic odors they
exhale. Perfumes of lilacs and primroses—lilacs
and primroses thrice intensified—greet
me when <i>Oncidium incurvum</i> and <i>Dendrobium
heterocarpum</i> are in bloom. The
redolence of jasmines, jonquils, and cyclamens
is combined in many of the <i>Cattleyas</i>,
while <i>Odontoglossum gloriosum</i> seems a
whole hawthorn hedge in flower. I open
the door of the warm-house when the <i>Vandas</i>
are in bloom, and I know not what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>subtle overpowering fragrance weighs
down the air. What a sachet and censer
of perfume! what a spice-box of the Orient!
Cleopatra might have just passed
through. Such strange odors! languorous,
sensuous, all but intoxicating! I expect to
hear a tom-tom’s beat, or the rustle of a
houri’s skirt. Some of the <i>Stanhopeas</i>,
how powerful their scent—a <i>pot-pourri</i> of
all the gums of Brazil! The suave yet pungent
aroma exhaled by one of the <i>Oncidiums</i>
(<i>O. ornithorhynchum</i>), I can never
get enough of. Its insidious, delicious fragrance
defies analysis; it haunts me like an
unremembered dream or a thought that
has escaped. Intensely red flowers are
seldom odorous; the brilliant <i>Sophronites</i>—some
of them the purest essence of scarlet—are
scentless. The <i>Phalænopsis</i>, too, although
among the most floriferous of orchids,
are likewise inodorous.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is fascinating to attempt to trace the
resemblance of some of the odors. G. W.
Septimus Piesse would be at a loss to place
many of them or to determine their combination.
Some, on the contrary, are distinctly
like many well-known and grateful
odors, though generally much more pronounced.
From <i>Dendrobium aureum</i> and
<i>Cattleya gigas</i> there rises a triple extract of
violets; from <i>Cattleya citrina</i>, a strong fragrance
of limes; from <i>D. scabrilingue</i>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>delicious breath of wall-flowers; from <i>D.
moschatum</i>, a pronounced musk-like scent.
Besides <i>Odontoglossum gloriosum</i>, both
<i>Burlingtonia fragrans</i> and <i>Trichopilia
suavis</i> emit a perfume of hawthorn. One
of the <i>Zygopetalums</i> smells like hyacinths,
one of the <i>Oncidiums</i> like cinnamon,
one of the <i>Catasetums</i> like anise.
The straw-colored flowers of <i>C. scurra</i>
have a pronounced perfume of lemons.
<i>Cymbidium Mastersii</i> is charged with the
odor of almonds. <i>Dendrobium incurvum</i>
is distinctly jasmine scented. A mellifluous
essence of cyclamen clusters about
<i>D. Dominianum</i>. Not a few orchids smell
like honey, while in others I can plainly
trace the scent of elder flower, heliotrope,
the wild grape, sweet pea, vanilla,
tuberose, honeysuckle, lily of the valley,
and various tropical fruits, like the pine-apple,
banana, and <i>Monstera</i>. The majority
of the <i>Vandas</i> and <i>Stanhopeas</i>, and not a
few of the <i>Cattleyas</i>, are puzzling to place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Form is scarcely less strange than odor
in many orchids, most of the species bearing
a pronounced or faint resemblance to
some form of bird, insect, or animal life.
The <i>Masdevallias</i> and <i>Maxillarias</i>, how
like the walking-stick and water-skaters
many of them are! My primrose-scented
<i>Dendrobium</i> looks like a flock of lovely
buff-colored moths ready to take flight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from the stems. The ivory-white flowers
of <i>Angræcum sesquipidale</i>, whose perfume
so strongly resembles that of the white garden
lily, look like a starfish. These <i>Stanhopeas</i>,
whose emanations are almost overpowering
and whose spikes emerge from
the bottom of their suspended baskets, remind
me of serpents in the form and spots
of their fleshy, purplish or orange-dyed
flowers. The flowers of the species <i>Anguloa</i>
resemble a bull’s head; those of <i>Cycnoches
Loddigesii</i>, a swan. In the white
waxen flower of <i>Peresteria elata</i> I trace the
symbol of immortality—a dove with expanded
wings; in the terrestrial <i>Ophrys</i> I
almost hear the humming of its bees. Many
species closely resemble spiders and beetles;
others seem almost an exact counterfeit of
various moths and butterflies—there is no
end to the strange resemblances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Color is scarcely less strange than odor
and form. These abnormal spots and
blotches, these oddly tipped petals and
painted sepals, I meet in no other flower.
The lily, <i>Sternbergia</i>, and anemone have
each been singled out as the candidate for
the honor of being referred to in the twenty-ninth
verse of the sixth chapter of St.
Matthew. But was any one of these, or even
Solomon himself, arrayed like <i>Dendrobium
Wardianum</i>? The most gorgeous of its
gorgeous tribe, it is perhaps the most gorgeous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of flowers; and among the easiest
grown species, it blossoms freely, suspended
in the library from a block of wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must watch long to see a blue or purple
orchid in bloom, colors common enough
among garden and other greenhouse flowers.
True red and vermilion are extremely
rare, yellow in its various shades being
perhaps the most common color, green and
white occupying an almost equal place.
Brown-shaded or brown-spotted flowers
are common, and there exist numerous
pink-purples and crimsons. Magenta frequently
creeps into the <i>Cattleyas</i>, staining
the crest of the pearl or cream-colored lobe,
or splashing the curled or fimbriated lip. But
magenta lends itself better to orchids than
to other flowers; and objectionable as it
generally is, it may be pardoned in some of
the <i>Cattleyas</i>. It is a tropical color and
brings perfume. Apart from the strange
odors, shapes, and colors of the flowers, the
orchid still continues exceptional in the
wonderful duration of its blooms both upon
the plant and in the cut stage. Epiphytal or
terrestrial, tropical or native, in all its aspects
the orchid is strange.</p>

<p class='c001'>How few, while admiring the gorgeous
beauty of an epiphytal orchid, think of the
price it has cost to transfer it from its tropical
habitat! For very many of the numerous
species have been obtained at the sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of human lives—martyrs to hardship,
exposure, and disease engendered while
wresting a new species from its miasma-infested
home. The accounts of many
orchid collectors who have lived to relate
their experiences read like the exploits of a
Stanley or a tale of Verne.</p>

<p class='c001'>If my orchids are chary of red, many
foliage plants supply this color abundantly,
and ferns the graceful leafage and lovely
greens which orchids lack. I say nothing
of the palm, the tree-fern, the <i>Monstera</i>, the
<i>Musa</i>, and similar large plants that require
special quarters where they may have ample
space to do them justice. But color and
form are supplied by many medium-sized
foliage plants of comparatively easy culture;
and in selecting these, like orchids, it is
well to choose a few of the finest and most
distinct, rather than crowd the stages with
a mass of plants of only average merit.
One can never cease to admire the brilliant
mottling and veining of the Croton’s evergreen
foliage, the grand purplish green
leaves of <i>Maranta Zebrina</i>, the elegant
markings of the <i>Calladium</i>, the velvety
crimson-mottled leaves of the <i>Gesneras</i>, the
polished bronze shields of <i>Alocassia metallica</i>,
the bronze-green and satiny luster of
the <i>Camphylobtrys</i>, the vivid exquisite red
tones of the <i>Dracæna’s</i> younger leafage, and
the <i>Poinsettia’s</i> fiery scarlet whorls. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>no other red, even that of the pomegranate,
is quite so intense as the flaming
spathe and spadix of several of the great
tropical aroids belonging to the species
<i>Anthurium</i>, valuable for their fine foliage as
well as for their startling flowers. An interesting
foliage plant is the old <i>Strelitzia
reginæ</i>, producing singular brilliant orange
and purple flowers, one continually pushing
up beneath the other from its magical
wand. The <i>Imatophyllum</i>, or <i>Clivia</i>, is
likewise a satisfactory foliage plant, apart
from the showy florescence of its large
umbel of twelve to fifteen coppery-red blossoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The variegated form of the pine-apple
(<i>Ananas bracteatus</i>) goes farther than any
other greenhouse plant in its combined
appeal to the senses, its rich reddish foliage
pleasing the eye, and its rich red fruit captivating
the sense of sight, smell, and taste.
I fancy the smaller fruit of this variety is of
more pronounced flavor than that of the
type; but this may be simply owing to its
more inviting appearance. One needs no
other odor in the greenhouse when the
pine-apple is in fruit. It was a Huguenot
priest who described the pine-apple, three
centuries ago, as a gift of such excellence
that only the hand of Venus should gather
it. It might have fallen from the sky a
larger and more delicious strawberry. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>one who has tasted it only after it has been
plucked green and subjected to a long voyage
in the hold of a vessel, can conceive its
ambrosial flavor when cut ripe from the
stem. It is a fresh revelation to the taste; it
almost renews one’s youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some specimens of the <i>Sarracenias</i> or
pitcher-plants are interesting, though when
suspended from their baskets they lack
their native grace. I always recall the <i>Sarracenia</i>
as I first met it, its purple cups and
rufous-green leaves fringing a deep black
pool. Springing from the sphagnum, cotton-rose,
and cranberry tangle of the
swamp, it seemed to possess a conscious
life of freshness and of color, callous to November
frost and cold. The thick carpet of
cranberry upheld the footstep on the quaking
bog, and every tread spilled the water
from the <i>Sarracenia’s</i> brimming cups and
leaves. Aflame with scarlet berries, a
growth of black-alder skirted the outer
edges of the pool; on the rising ground beyond,
the gray boles and gilded foliage of a
beech grove were illumined by the sinking
sun. It was a study for a Ruysdael or a
Diaz, if a Diaz could reproduce the mellow
grays and reds of the sphagnum and the
<i>Sarracenia</i>. Fontainebleau or the thickets
of Bas-Bréau hold no such pool; it is alone
the product of a wild New World swamp.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of flowers grown for the sake of fragrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>alone, or beauty of blossom and fragrance
combined, it is difficult to specify
which are the most desirable—so many are
so beautiful. Such stiff, soulless subjects
as the camellia and calla are worthless, and
should be thrown out of the greenhouse—there
are too many good things to take
their place. A flower should have a meaning,
or a sentiment attached to it; and the
camellia and calla have none; they are frigid
even for the grave. Many of the glaring
blues, purples, crimsons, and magentas of the
<i>Cinerarias</i>, and some of the agonizing reds
of the Chinese primrose are equally to be
avoided as so much rubbish for which the
greenhouse has no room. The common
pink begonia, which every one grows because
every one else grows it, should likewise
be left out in favor of many other
better varieties of its class. Of roses there
can not well be too many; and of these a
well-grown Maréchal Niel or a Gloire de
Dijon can scarcely be excelled for luxuriance,
fragrance, and beauty of bloom.</p>

<p class='c001'>I should hesitate which to pronounce
the most satisfactory—the cyclamen or the
lily of the valley, both are so sweet. The
latter is much more easily raised; the former
must be sowed from seed yearly; it
does not propagate. The fragrance of the
cyclamen is delicious and distinct. But it is
of a variable quantity, some kinds being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>delightfully scented, and some odorless.
Marie Louise violets—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The violet of March that comes with spring,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>should, of course, be generously grown in
frames connected with the greenhouse, to
cut from <i>ad libitum</i>; there is no other indoor
or outdoor flower to take the place of
the violet. Neither can the carnation be
dispensed with, this colored clove among
flowers, which only demands a cool temperature
to repay cultivation. And how
could one be without the haunting fragrance
of mignonette!</p>
<p class='c001'>Tulips, hyacinths, and crocus, methinks,
should not be raised indoors—their true
place is in the April garden without, to
herald the returning spring. A few of the
white, salmon, and vermilion geraniums
are showy and sometimes useful, especially
the small double vermilion; the majority
do not compare with many of the fine discarded
pelargoniums which florists complain
they can not sell, for the simple reason
that they do not raise them. The fuchsia
has some fine and striking forms; the majority
are undesirable. The heliotrope is
desirable for its fragrance, though it withers
quickly when cut. The <i>Freesia</i> is an easily
grown and beautiful flower that should be
forced as abundantly as the <i>Convallaria</i> for
cutting. <i>Daphne Indica</i> and <i>odora</i> one can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>not well do without, and equally valuable
for fragrance are the climbing Madagascar
<i>Stephanotis</i> and some of the jasmines.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among other desirable climbers possessing
fragrance should be included some of
the passion flowers and the showy yellow
Brazilian <i>Allamanda</i>. A few specimen
plants of the fragrant Chinese azalea are
always ornamental, and useful for cutting;
some of the rose-colored kinds are among
the gayest of greenhouse flowers, notably the
old variety “Rosette.” A somewhat difficult
hot-house plant to grow is <i>Alstrœmeria
ligtu</i>, with white and scarlet flowers appearing
during February, and possessing a strong
scent of mignonette. The pure waxy white
flowers of the <i>Eucharis</i>, or lily of the Amazon,
are invaluable for cutting, the robust
bulbous plants being easily raised, and producing
their flower-trusses in great luxuriance.
For cutting, the numerous species of
narcissus can scarcely be equaled; from the
many beautiful bunch-flowered varieties of
the <i>tazetta</i>, and the glorious blooms of the
large trumpeters, to the smaller hoop-petticoat
daffodil and golden campernelle jonquil.
A plant seldom seen under glass, but
an excellent plant, notwithstanding, is the
common sweet-scented yellow day lily (<i>Hemerocallis
flava</i>), than which few flowers
are more beautiful either in the garden
or greenhouse. Where one has sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>space, the garden lilac may be advantageously
grown in the greenhouse, care being
taken not to force it too fast, or the trusses
soon droop when cut.</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, no greenhouse is complete
without the chrysanthemum, which, defying
the first frosts without, makes us forget the
approach of winter within. I still grow the
old-fashioned small-flowered white, yellow,
and maroon pompons. Of recent years
hybridizing has produced an innumerable
quantity of large, loose <i>outré</i> forms among the
Chinese and Japanese sections. In many
cases this has been done at the sacrifice of
bloom and beauty of color. Dingy brown
disks have crept into the flowers; and the
chrysanthemum may be said to have deteriorated
rather than improved under too
much cultivation.</p>

THE dining-room is large and lofty,
having been planned with special
reference to ventilation, spaciousness,
and the attractive
views it commands of the copse,
the garden, and the rising and the setting
sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it is pleasant to dream in the well-furnished
library, if it is a delight to muse
and study amid harmonious surroundings,
how much more important it is that the
great nursery of a pleasing frame of mind,
the dining-room, should by its inviting surroundings
and the care and intelligence bestowed
upon its adjuncts, the kitchen and
the wine-cellar, contribute equally to the
felicity of the house and home!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>With the exception of the ball-room, the
dining-room should be the most spacious
apartment of the house. For is it not the
most occupied and visited? Three times
daily, at least, the inmates assemble here;
and in the case of entertainments I observe it
is invariably a shrine to which the guests
repair with almost one accord. To be
sure, the host and hostess are not entirely
neglected, and the flow of conversation is
never wholly restrained in the drawing-room.
Yet I have never failed to notice,
where a large assemblage of invited guests
is present in any house, how powerful a
magnet the dining-room possesses. This
not only to the sleek and rubicund among
the sterner sex—men who are known for
their fondness for good cheer; but even to
the slim and ethereal among the gentler sex,
as well. Pale sylphs whom one would
scarcely suspect capable of an accomplished
play of a knife and fork, staid matrons,
blooming rosebuds, and elderly dames, all
seem no less fascinated with the charms of
the dining-room. It is the source and dispensator
of joy when its appointments are
perfect—the one room of all rooms of the
house which may not be abolished.</p>

<p class='c001'>How may I enjoy the other portions of
my house if the dinner be poorly served
and the environments amid which it is partaken
be dismal or unattractive? The dinner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>should be the diapason to pitch one in
the right key for the evening, whether it
be the perusal of a favorite author, a moonlight
stroll, a ball, or a symposium with
one’s friends. Carlyle’s dining-room, I
venture to say, was a gloomy one; or his
cook, lacking a happy turn for an <i>entrée</i>,
served him with ponderous <i>pièces de résistance</i>,
thereby the more intensifying his
natural acerbity and want of geniality. Is
the German invariably happy, overflowing
with <i>Gemüthlichkeit</i>? He has three hundred
and sixty-five soups, one for every
day in the year. Is the Frenchman proverbially
polite and effervescent? His delicate
<i>ragoûts</i> and fragrant Bordeaux are a
constant tonic to his spirits. “Repose is
as much the result of a well-organized digestion
as of a quiet mind,” observes the
axiomatic and irrefutable author of the 366
Menus. Thrice blessèd he who has a
good conscience and a good cook. Your
conscience may be as clear as a mountain
brook, however, but without a good digestion
life becomes a weariness.</p>

<p class='c001'>A pleasant dining-room and a well-appointed
kitchen, therefore, become among
the most important factors in the happiness
of the household—the best means of defeating
that <i>ennui</i> which, according to Schopenhauer,
fills the moiety of a man’s life. The
Savarins, the La Reynières, and the Baron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Brisses can never be too many. “I regard
the discovery of a new dish,” said the late
Henrion de Pensey, the magistrate (according
to M. Royer Collard), of whom regenerated
France has most reason to be proud,
“as a far more interesting event than the
discovery of a star, for we always have
stars enough, but we can never have too
many dishes; and I shall not regard the
sciences as sufficiently honored or adequately
represented among us until I see a cook
in the first class of the Institute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They manage these things better in
France, though the art of gastronomy of
late years has advanced as rapidly in this
country, perhaps, as any of its sister arts.
It is no longer a burden to approach the
dinner-table; and while we may not have
transposed the maxim that Harpagon
deemed so noble, nevertheless, it may be
affirmed, in the strict sense of the expression,
that we no longer “eat to live.” For
is not this among the highest of arts—a
sauce “that, when properly prepared, will
enable one to eat an elephant?” as Grimod
de la Reynière observes in the Almanach
des Gourmands. With an abundant supply
of herbs and flavorings, a hygienic appreciation
of their virtues, and a refined,
discriminating taste, all is possible. The
“palate is flattered” and the stomach is
not fatigued. If the cook or the person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>who employs him would only carry out
the advice the Almanach prescribes, in order
that the cook’s palate may retain its exquisite
sensibility, and the trained papillæ
of his tongue forever command their cunning!</p>

<p class='c001'>These fine savors, these subtle aromas
of a delicious dish, delicate as the fragrance
of a wild flower, and companions of the
liquid essences of the Gironde, the Côte
d’Or, the Marne, and the Rheingau—when
conceived and executed by a true priest or
priestess of the range, how they refresh the
jaded spirits and turn the lowering winter
sky into <i>couleur de rose</i>! It remained for
a woman, the late Mrs. Mary Booth, to give
to posterity the most delicious epigram that
has yet been uttered regarding dinners and
dinner-giving: “A successful dinner is the
best thing which the world can do in the
pursuit of pleasure. It is the apotheosis of
the present, and the present moment is all
we can call our own.” Neither let us forget
for a single instant, where dinner-giving
is concerned, the golden maxim of
Baron Brisse: “A host whose guest has
had to ask for anything is a dishonored
man!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the dinner be served in a well-lighted,
spacious, and pleasantly furnished room; let
the chairs be easy, the guests not less than
eight nor more than ten (<i>les dîners fins se
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>font en petit comité</i>), the linen spotless, the
service faultless. Let the wines not exceed
four—a light hock, redolent of the fruit of
the Riesling; a glass or two of Montepulciano
or of Pichon-Longueville, two <i>flûtes</i>
of half dry champagne (cider rather than
“<i>brût</i>”) or sparkling dry Saint-Péray; and
for the after-taste—the last taste of sweets—the
perfumed sunshine of Sauternes, Lafaurie,
or La Tour Blanche of a well-succeeded
year, iced to snow. “A glass of wine,”
Richard Sheridan used to say, “would encourage
the bright thought to come; and
then it was right to take another to reward
it for coming.” Let the courses not exceed
seven, including the salad; let the
room be well ventilated; the flowers mildly
stimulating rather than cloying in their fragrance;
let the repast not exceed two and
a half hours in duration—and, for the present
at least, we are—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>The senseless practice of decanting wine can
not be too strongly condemned. A delicate
wine seems never the same as when poured
from the bottle in which it has ripened and
in which it has concentrated its odors.
The practice, moreover, is incongruous; for
even he who decants his “claret” would
not think of needlessly dissipating the bouquet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of his hock. As for the matter of sediment
being avoided by decanting, decanted
wines are invariably seen in a clouded condition,
their bloom having been brushed
off by the very process of decanting. By
laying all bottles on their side, with the
label uppermost, while they remain in the
repose of the cellar, and then placing them
upright a day or a few hours before they
are required, the question of sediment is at
once disposed of. Then, if the wine be
carefully poured, label upward, it wells
forth as limpid as a woodland spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally to be censured is the increasing
custom of serving wine in colored glasses—a
fashion inaugurated by the gentler sex in
order to add a supposititious life to the table.
Apart from the great mistake of thus masking
the color of the wine itself, and thereby
impairing its attractiveness to the eye, there
is no color produced by the most cunning
artificer in glass which approaches the colors
extracted from the skin of the grapes
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>What green Bohemian glass may equal
in hue this golden green of Liebfrauenmilch
that so enhances the flavor of these speckled
trout which but yesterday were swimming
amid the waving water-cresses of the
stream?</p>

<p class='c001'>Or shall I obliterate the lovely color of
Bordeaux which, captivating the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>seeing, thus additionally heightens through
the imagination the exquisite bouquet and
flavor of the grand growths of the Médoc?
Disguised in an opaque receptacle, how
may I enjoy the liquid gold of Sauternes or
the deep violets and purples which dance
and gleam in a glass of Côte Rôtie? Yet
more than clear crystal is required in the
ideal wine-glass. The most delicious nectar
loses half its virtues if drunk from a thick
glass or a sharp, rough rim, as the foaming
juice of Champagne is deprived of its greatest
charm—its bewitching, mantling life—when
served in the flat tumbler that deadens
its sparkle and its bead.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not without just reason that Boileau
declared:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On est savant quand on boit bien;</div>

      <div class='line'>Who knows not drinking nothing knows.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>And Jean le Houx, in the dedication of
his sparkling Vaux de Vire—anacreontics
which are unique in the languages—asserts
that his best verses were produced by
drinking good wine, while inferior wine
was responsible for the poorest. It would
be interesting to know what special wines
inspired the incomparable tribute to his
nose—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>or whether it was white or red wine that
drew forth the frolicsome stanzas addressed
to Magdaleine.</p>
<p class='c001'>Le Houx deserves to be classed among
the great philosophers. It is to be regretted,
however, that his philosophy did not
extend to dining as well as wining—though,
for that matter, the eight little 18mo volumes
of the Almanach des Gourmands,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c022'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
justly classed by Monselet among the great
forgotten books, leave nothing to be desired
on the subject of epicurism in its most infinitesimal
and far-extending details. The
humor and <i>verve</i> are exquisite, while La
Reynière’s style might come under the
definition of Remy Belleau-“well-coupled
and properly sewn words, graces and favors
of a well-chosen subject, and I do not
know what happy chance (<i>et ne sçay quel
heur</i>), which truly accompanies those who
write well.” Only, the Almanach is in
prose. With all due regard for Berchoux
and his poem in four cantos, La Gastronomie,
the editions of which are almost as
numerous as the stars in the Milky Way,
the French genius is yet to appear who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>may do full justice in verse to the pleasures
of the table.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Le Houx’s charming eulogies are by
no means confined to wine. Cider, among
the most refreshing and prophylactic of summer
beverages when well made, evokes almost
equally the playful strains of his lyre.
Not less renowned than the juice of the apple
of Devonshire is the potent apple juice
of Normandy, and even in his reference to
this there constantly occurs the oft-repeated
refrain:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Drinking is sweeter than a kiss to me.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The true <i>raison d’être</i> of the Vaux de
Vire, it may be stated, was a jealous wife.
Since the time of Le Houx there have been
other jealous spouses that have driven their
husbands to the bottle or to something
worse; but none have done so with such
smiling effect as the wife of the wine-loving
lawyer-poet of Vire.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the wine at the proper temperature
(and this point it is the bounden duty
of the host to personally superintend), a
few well-prepared courses partaken of with
congenial friends amid pleasant surroundings
will prove far more agreeable and
leave more grateful remembrances than the
most elaborate banquet. In dining, more
than in anything else, quality rather than
quantity paves the way to happiness.
The <i>petit</i>, and not the <i>grand dîner</i> is the
grace of the table. Like many of the accidental
things of life—the chance meeting,
the suddenly conceived excursion, the unexpected
visit from out-of-town friends—it
is often the impromptu repast which inspires
the most delightful souvenirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was years ago, though I remember it
as distinctly as if it were yesterday, when I
found my friend St. Ange, after an absence
of many months, ensconced in the library,
La Gastronomie in one hand and the epicurean
epigrams of Martial in the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Julienne soup, some smelt with a tartare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>sauce, sheep’s tongues <i>à la Jardinière</i>,
quail, and an endive salad were to compose
the dinner. My guest’s rosy face took on an
added luster. His eyes brightened perceptibly
at the mention of the quail.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me prepare them!” he exclaimed.
“I will show you how to make a <i>salmis</i> of
quail that is not down in the cook-books;
it is composed as you would blend and
form an exquisite perfume:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thy crown of roses or of spikenard be;</div>
      <div class='line'>A crown of thrushes is the crown for me.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c022'><sup>[14]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>I term it a <i>salmis à la bourgeois gentilhomme</i>;
like Molière’s <i>comédie-ballet</i>, it is piquant
and full of delightful surprises. Give
me the quail, the shallots, the truffles, the
mushrooms, and you will never forget me!”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Martial. Elphinston’s translation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c001'>There were four larded quails, freshly
roasted.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took a piece of unsalted butter the
size of an egg, placed it in the porcelain
sauce-pan, and allowed it to liquefy. When
it began to bubble, he put in two shallots
and two sprigs of parsley finely minced,
stirring until browned, adding a teaspoonful
of sifted flour. When well incorporated,
he supplemented this with two cupfuls of
bouillon, a pinch of salt, and for the <i>bouquet
garni</i> a third of a bay-leaf, two cloves, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>small piece of cinnamon, a pinch of thyme, a
dash of allspice and the merest trifle of nutmeg.
Next he added two sliced truffles of
Périgord, the juice of a can of button mushrooms,
a tablespoonful of cognac, a tablespoonful
of water, and a wine-glass each of
Chablis and St. Julien.</p>

<p class='c001'>His face glowed, his hazel eyes sparkled,
and every little while he tasted of the
savory <i>liaison</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>After pouring in the wine, he allowed
the sauce to boil until reduced to the desired
consistency. The can of mushrooms was
then added; and about ten minutes before
serving, one of the quail was permitted to
simmer in the perfumed sauce. Immediately
previous to placing the <i>salmis</i> in the
chafing-dish, and decorating it with <i>croutons</i>,
he dropped in a pepper-corn and
stirred briskly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>‘Voilà qui est bien;’ c’est parfait,
mon cher!</i>” he said with a smile; “<i>le salmis
a bien réussi!</i></p>

<p class='c001'>“I always use a good many herbs and
seasonings,” he continued, “though I employ
them only in very small quantities.
By using them, infinite variety of flavorings
may be produced, and they are, moreover,
a great tonic to the stomach if dealt out by
a judicious hand. Hence the superiority
of good French cooking; variety is the
spice of digestion. Indeed, pleasing savors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>or sapid impressions usually exert the
greatest influence upon the function of
digestion. If they are good and agreeable,
the secretion of the gastric juice is abundant,
mastication is prolonged, deglutition
and chylification are easy and rapid. If
they are bad or repugnant, mastication becomes
a labor, deglutition difficult, and a
distressed feeling is the inevitable result.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perfection in cooking consists in rendering
all such substances as may be utilized
for food as agreeable to the taste as they
are easy to digest. The cook, therefore,
besides possessing a palate of extreme delicacy,
should be thoroughly acquainted with
the hygienic properties of all the herbs and
seasonings he employs, and this equally
with reference to their effect upon the stomach
as with regard to their pleasing impression
upon the organ of taste. All
spices and kindred stimulants should be
used with the utmost tact and discrimination.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the pleasures that flit about the
well-appointed table—the appetite which is,
after all, the best of sauces and that leads to
good digestion and consequent health and
enjoyment of the other pleasures of life—depend
upon more than the <i>chef</i> and the
<i>cuisine</i>. Back of the most seductive dish
and piquant sauce, there remains the capacity
to enjoy them, which is alone to be attained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>in its fullest measure by regular habits
(habits as regular, at least, as rational
pleasure and recreation will allow); and
that greatest and purest of tonics and prophylactics—exercise
in the open air.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In due time the <i>entrée</i> was partaken of.
The impromptu <i>chef</i> had upset the kitchen
from casserole to <i>pot-au-feu</i>, but his <i>salmis</i>
was worthy of Carème.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a great bunch of double violets
on the table, the lovely dark blue variety
(<i>Viola odoratissima fl. pl.</i>) with the
short stems, freshly plucked from the violet
frame of the garden, and the room was
scented by their delicious breath.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bowl of broad-leaved Batavian endive
blanched to a nicety and alluring as a siren’s
smile was placed upon the table. I almost
fancied it was smiling at the violets. A
blue-violet salad, by all means! there are
violets, and to spare.</p>

<p class='c001'>On a separate dish there was a little
minced celery, parsley, and chives. Four
heaping salad-spoonfuls of olive oil were
poured upon the herbs, with a dessertspoonful
of white-wine vinegar (the best in the
world comes from Orléans, France), the
necessary salt and white pepper, and a
tablespoonful of Bordeaux. The petals of
two dozen violets were detached from the
stems, and two thirds of them were incorporated
with the dressing. The dressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>being thoroughly mixed with the endive,
the remaining flower petals were sprinkled
over the salad and a half-dozen whole violets
placed in the center.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lovely blue sapphires glowed upon
the white bosom of the endive! It was the
true sequence of the <i>salmis</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A white-labeled bottle, capsuled Yquem,
and the cork branded “Lur Saluces,” was
served with the salad. You note the subtle
aroma of pine-apple and fragrance of flower
ottos with the detonation of the cork—the
fine vintages of Yquem have a pronounced
<i>Ananassa</i> flavor and bouquet that steeps the
palate with its richness and scents the surrounding
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now try your blue-violet salad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it fragrant? is it cool? is it delicious?
is it divine?</p>

MY books, my flowers, and my colorful
interior surroundings do
much to relieve the monotony of
the long winter months. Not
until <i>Aries</i> appears for his accustomed
charge upon the spring do I yearn
intently for its advent. Then the days seem
the longest—the tedious days of waiting;
the longest days, which are to come, will
be the shortest. For the days may not be
measured by the length, but by the flight
of the hours and the beauty they bring; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>sun and the shadows shorten the longest
day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Does not a restlessness come to man with
the ascending sap in the trees, when he
likewise would cast off the inertia that has
possessed him, and respond to the magical
touch of the sun? There is much that is
beautiful in the mythopœic representation
of the seasons. All winter, says the legend,
the sweet sunshine is chased by the relentless
storm, now hiding beneath the clouds,
now below the hills, showing herself for a
moment merely to flee again. But, finally
becoming bolder, the Sunshine advances to
meet the Storm, who, captivated by her
beauty, woos her as he pursues her, and
wins her for his bride. Then is there great
rejoicing upon the earth, and from their
union are born plants which spring from its
surface and spangle it with flowers. But
every autumn the Storm begins to frown
anew, the Sunshine flees from him, and the
pursuit begins again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is not the sunshine, more than anything
else, the prelude to spring? How it sifts
and permeates through the windows into
one’s very being, this first March sunshine!
Looked at from within it is already spring
without, so luminous the atmosphere and
so soft the shadows. Perfectly aware am I
that it may not continue and that the storm
will cause the sunlight to hide itself again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>just as it has done so often before when it
merely gleamed for a moment from the
edge of the cloud. Even now the fickle
sun sinks behind a sharp dark band in the
west. The mole must retreat to his burrow;
to-morrow the storm and the snow!
At least the flowers will be shielded from
the chilling blasts, and Nature work her
own reward. Still must the north wind
beat ere the south breeze may blow. But
how, while it lasts, the sunlight warms
where it falls, drawing a scarlet aureole
from the maple, setting the snow-banks
free, and liberating the ice-locked streams.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every morning now must the Sun rise
earlier to fulfill his task. The buds of a
million forests long for his touch, hillsides
of spring beauty and violets are eager for
his approach, the flowers in every meadow
and woodland are awaiting his alchemy.
Already the willow catkins have stirred at
his caress. The shrubby dogwood has felt
his force, and kindles into flame. The
wands of the golden willow are gilded
anew; the red horn of the great aroid is
peering from the mold.</p>

<p class='c001'>Think of his task! To clear the earth of
its coverlet of snow and clarify the streams;
to burst the chrysalis and put forth the leaves;
to push up the grass blades and perfume the
flowers; to breathe upon and resuscitate all
the dormant world of vegetable and animal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>life. The leaflets upon leaflets and fern
fronds upon fern fronds the sunshine must
unfold; the acres of grain and the clover
fields it must fall upon; the myriad fruits it
must ripen!</p>

<p class='c001'>Lo! how marvelous the task; a smile
and a summons for all!</p>

<p class='c001'>Down in the hollows of the wood where
the wind-flowers grow, under the meadow-grasses
where the blue flag and lily bulbs
wait, below the waters to bid the marsh
marigolds and arrowheads rise, into the farthest
swamps where the orchid hides, in
waste places where tares and teazles crowd,
on countless hillsides and in countless valleys
must the sunbeams penetrate and
quicken to awakened life. And all this
gradually, little by little, day by day, hour
by hour, bringing forth each blossom at
its appointed time, giving the butterfly his
wings, providing the bee his sustenance.
What is there here on earth to compare with
the miracle of returning spring, the labor and
strength of the Sun? The power of Hercules
a trillion fold is concentrated in the
rays that are loosing the fetters of the streams
to-day. Lo! the marvel of the renascent
year, when Earth renews her youth and
Nature is born again.</p>

<p class='c001'>The March days pass, and more and
more is the Sun’s strength felt. His vassals,
the showers and the south winds, he calls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>to aid him in his task; and at once the
grasses and larches turn green and arbutus
and bloodroot are fanned into bloom. A
mile away the sunshine lights the hills; a
league away it burnishes and warms the
river. Daily the beams stream upon the
earth and reveal fresh treasures. Swiftly a
shadow steals along the hills. The tempered
April rain falls from the gray April
sky. Responsive, the sward assumes a
brighter green, the daffodil a richer gold.
The sap mounts to the topmost branches
and penetrates the minutest twigs. Day by
day the naked sprays are feathered by the
pushing buds. A scarf of green is flung
across the copse. The shadblow silvers the
woods, columbine and cranesbill throng the
slopes, and hepatica and dog-tooth violet
nod to the quickening breeze of spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spring days pass, but the miracle
remains; hourly a new marvel is wrought
by the sunlight and the shower. The oriole
appears and orchards burst into bloom; the
wood-thrush sings and the dogwood and
wild thorn join the flowering pageant. The
warm perfumed breath of the new year
floats upon the air—the breath of flower
and grass and expanding bud. Nature’s
color-box opens anew; her brush is laid
upon each petal with what consummate
address and variety!—pink upon the petals
of the peach, a flush on the cheek of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>apple bloom, a gloss of gold upon the buttercup.
The Trillium thrusts up its snowy
triangles, the gold-thread its white stars,
and banks become purple with violets.
Tiny polypody and oak-fern replume the
stumps and bowlders. From the frost-smitten
meadows and waste places rise
fresh pennants of green. Unfurled is the
flag of spring. And the hues and odors
that are still in embryo and the sunshine is
preparing—all the sweets of June and the
infinite beauties of midsummer, the wealth
of the roses, the clover bloom, the labyrinthine
tangle of wild flowers, even to the
asters and colored leaf of autumn. The
foam and surge of the apple bloom are but
a wave of the color and fragrance that is to
be. Æons ago the March sunlight fell upon
the flowers and primeval nature. Vegetation
welcomed it then as it welcomes it
now. Next year and the next year and
centuries hence will it fall upon the earth
and work out the miracle of spring. Is it
not new and ever beautiful, this vernal resurrection?
That we, too, possessed this
subtle alchemy and might extract this elixir
from the April sun!</p>

<p class='c001'>How the wings of the doves glisten and
mirror the rays as I watch them floating by
my windows! I love my flock of doves—the
dove is so associated with the relentment
of the elements and the olive leaf of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>spring. A monotonous life they lead in
their diurnal circlings round the barn and
their self-same route over their circumscribed
domain—a monotonous life, at
least, it appears to the observer, while
probably the very reverse to them. Every
load of grain which comes to the neighboring
barns they may note from their vantage-ground
and meditate upon its special virtues.
The droppings of the barley now
being stored in yonder granary undoubtedly
form as weighty a subject to them as the
fluctuations in the market do to the maltster
himself. Then the incertitude which
must attend the obtaining of their supply
of food naturally furnishes them with a constant
source of speculation; besides, who but
they themselves may know what petty bickerings
and jealousies form the daily routine
of their inner life? The jaunty leader of the
flock who curves his iris neck so proudly
may be the humblest of hen-pecked fathers in
the privacy of his home; and what appears
to be the approving cooings of devoted
dames may be only a prosaic homily on the
part of his exacting wives.</p>

<p class='c001'>My flock of doves seem alway idling
and courting the sunbeam. Now, apparently,
they are drifting aimlessly upon the
air; again they veer suddenly, to turn a
gleaming wing for me to admire. With
what indescribable grace the circling forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>hover over the eaves after each of their
tours of investigation, the swiftly fanning
wings seeming to cease their motion simultaneously
as the flock alights, and once more
preens its iris in the sun. Indecision is a
characteristic of my flock of doves—always
uncertain of the direction they would take,
and apparently never satisfied for more than
a passing moment with their surroundings.
No sooner have they flown to the meadow
beyond the copse than they are back again;
and scarcely have they perched upon the
roof or discovered fresh pickings ere they
take flight in another direction, to return as
quickly. Is it that they, like the rest of us,
are never content, and that much must have
more? I should like to quote them a lyric
from John Wilbye’s Second Set of Madrigals,
which possibly they may not have
heard:</p>

<p class='c001'>The first of the migratory flocks have
come. Is it the robins or the bluebirds
first, or the omnipresent song-sparrow
scattering his notes like a shower? Warm
as the scarlet of his wings is the greeting of
the starling from his haven in the reeds;
and ah! how sweet the carol of the meadow-lark
from the distant fields. Again I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>hear the warble which the blackbird
dropped when flying over the autumnal
stubbles, only it has a cheeriness that is
alone brought forth by sunshine and the
lengthening days. Little flutings and grace
notes rise from sheltered thickets and sunny
hollows—assemblages of snow-birds, Canada
sparrows, and red-polls practicing
their <i>Fruehlingslied</i>. The white-throated
sparrow’s silver strain I hear on every side,
the very beat of the spring-tide and song
of the sunshine. Even the voice of the
crow has a softer tone. From my study
windows I watch the sable hosts returning
to their roost in the distant wood. I see
them slowly filing by during the winter, at
the appointed hour, but less numerously,
and seldom audibly. Now they voice their
passage; their shadows cast a sound. From
time immemorial they have occupied a
roost in the same wood, their numbers
apparently neither increasing nor diminishing.
The first squads fly over early in the
evening, re-enforcements arriving continually
until dusk. They come from all directions,
the total assemblage numbering perhaps a
thousand. Above the tree-tops, for half an
hour before dark, there ascends a weird
chorus of evening, composed of every shade
of corvine <i>basso</i>, and <i>basso profondo</i>.
Borne from afar on the still evening air, the
hoarse notes come to me mellowed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>subdued—a fitting <i>ave</i> of the darkening
day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later, the first swallow races by, with
the first moth in his bill, urged on the
wider wings of the south wind—the first
swallows, rather; for there is not only one
but a score coursing through the ether, exultant
in the freedom of existence. Do
they, indeed, drop from the sky some bland
spring morning—spirits of dead children
revisiting their homes—as the fanciful Roman
legend has it? How swiftly they
cleave the air with their forked tail and
sickle-shaped wings! We marvel at the
soaring of the hawk, balancing himself in
an ever-widening and ascending circle,
ever tracing the curve of beauty. We
wonder at the agility of the humming-bird,
and his power of suspension in mid-air
over a flower. But the hawk barely flaps
a pinion, sustained through some inexplicable
agency in overcoming the natural
force of gravity; and the humming-bird
every little while rests from the friction of
the air. Is not the perpetual flight of the
swallow, his unceasing motion and incessant
turning upon himself a greater wonder?</p>

<p class='c001'>I stand on the margin of the stream just
before an impending shower, when a concourse
of hirundines is intent upon the
capture of its prey. The surface is dimpled
by the constant rising of feeding trout, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>brushed every now and then by a bird
drinking on the wing. It is a favorite
haunt of both fly-catchers and swallows,
lured by the rich insect fauna that congregate
above the still expanse of water, the
ephemerina dancing their joyous dance of
an hour. The stream is scarcely a rod and
a half wide. It is almost overarched with
bushes and trees, and abounds with curves.
There are at least forty swallows hawking
over it, all chasing above the glassy surface,
ceaselessly coming and going, swift as missiles
sprung from a sling. Yet not a catkin
of the alder tangle or blade of the
rushes is so much as grazed by a wing;
not a barbule of one bird ruffled by the
feather of another, amid all their lightning
turns and curvatures. It is the same in
their chase over a field when attracted close
to the earth by insects. It is the same in
their coursing through the air which I see
through my windows, only they have but
their fellows, and no other objects to avoid.
Yet even then their flight is a perpetual
wonder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sacred to the <i>penates</i> the swallow was
rightly held; it were a Vandal who would
harm them. Beloved wherever they roam
the sky, Procne has, nevertheless, been
comparatively neglected by the Muse, while
Philomela has received the greater homage.
Is not the swallow’s warble sweet, associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>as it is not only with the swallow’s
beauty, but with our very houses and barns
and the blue sky that bends above them?
Best known of all individual “pursuers of
the sun” is the bird mentioned in the fifth
stanza of the Elegy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>and his companion of the Winter’s Tale,
wheeling between daffodils and violets.
Keats’s line is among the most expressive
that have been written on the bird:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Swallows obeying the south summer’s call.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Hood’s simile is also fine:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Summer is gone on swallow’s wings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Gay, in The Shepherd’s Walk, has the
swallow do graceful duty as a weather-prophet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When swallows fleet soar high and sport in air,</div>
      <div class='line'>He told us that the welkin would be clear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Athenæus has referred as happily to the
bird as any of the old Greek poets in a fragment,
The Song of the Swallow:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The swallow is come, she is come to bring</div>
      <div class='line'>The laughing hours of the blithesome spring—</div>
      <div class='line'>The youth of the year and its sunshine bright—</div>
      <div class='line'>With her back all dark and her breast all white.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>From the Fables of Lessing I learn that
the swallow was originally as harmonious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and melodious a songster as the nightingale,
until, becoming wearied of dwelling in lonely
thickets to be heard and admired only by
peasants and shepherds, she forsook her
humble friends and took flight to the town.
But, in the mad rush of the city, men found
no time to listen to her heavenly lay, forgetting
which, by and by, instead of singing
she learned to build.</p>

<p class='c001'>I recall no reference to the swallow,
however, comparable to Charles Tennyson
Turner’s, in one of his many lovely sonnets,
Wind on the Corn. Not only the swallow
himself is there, wheeling and curveting in
all his buoyant grace, but the wind which
accelerates his speed, and the rippling wheat
field he loves to woo. The sonnet must be
read in its entirety, and to recall it calls for
no apology; it becomes the more beautiful
the more frequently it is read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Full often as I rove by path or stile</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To watch the harvest ripening in the vale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slowly and sweetly, like a growing smile—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A smile that ends in laughter—the quick gale</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the breadths of gold-green wheat descends;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While still the swallow, with unbaffled grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>About his viewless quarry dips and bends—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all the fine excitement of the chase</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies in the hunter’s beauty; in the eclipse</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of that brief shadow how the barley’s beard</div>
      <div class='line'>Tilts at the passing gloom, and wild rose dips</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Among the white-tops in the ditches reared;</div>
      <div class='line'>And hedgerow’s flowery breast of lacework stirs</div>
      <div class='line'>Faintly in that full wind that rocks the outstanding firs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Truly Boileau was right in his affirmation—a
faultless sonnet is in itself worth a long
poem; and Asselineau—fine sonnets, like
all beautiful things in this world, are without
price. No less beautiful is Turner’s
companion sonnet, A Summer Twilight—an
<i>intaglio</i> cut in green jade—where the
bat’s flitting shadow, instead of the swallow’s
flashing wing, imparts life and motion
to the scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first lady-bugs, called forth by the
grateful warmth, have left their hibernacle.
The first wasps and blue-bottle flies are
buzzing and bumping against the south
window panes. I catch the first <i>tremolo</i>
of the toads and piercing treble of the <i>hylodes</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>My first green bullfrog, too, “whom
the Muses have ordained to sing for aye.”
Again I hear his grand diapason, just as I
heard it last year and every year before as
long as I can remember. Apparently from
the same place in the marsh, amid the
pond-weeds and water-plantains, where he
suns himself and dozes by day, and launches
his <i>maestoso</i> at night. I wonder if it is really
the same frog, with his great yellow ears
and blinking eyes, and if ever he grows old?
It is the old voice from the old place, more
powerful and sonorous than the voices of
his fellows. What a fine time he has of it—slumbering
in the ooze throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>winter, while I am shaking with the cold;
cool and comfortable throughout the summer,
when I am sweltering with the heat;
with nothing to do but bask and bathe, or
thrust out his long tongue for the flies that
are foolish enough to think him asleep. I
heard him just two days earlier this year
than last, May 14, ten days later than the
first swallow to make his presence known.
It is said he must thrice put on his spectacles
ere he permanently deserts his couch in
the mire—i.e., look through the ice three
times before he rises with triumphant song.
He is invariably the latest of the spring
choristers, and at once his magnificent
<i>basso</i> completes the vernal pastoral.</p>

<p class='c001'>I wish I might obtain the recipe of his
spring bitters. Is it water-cresses or water-plantain?
It is evident he grows younger
with advancing years. “The croaking of
frogs,” said Martin Luther, “edifies nothing
at all; it is mere sophistry and fruitless.”
But, unlike the frog, Luther did
not relish a Diet of Worms; and I am not
sure that the woodcuts of the old reformer
do not resemble the head of my friend of
the swamp, whose melody floats so serenely
through the summer dusks. Horace,
generally correct, was wrong with respect
to the frog:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... Ranæque palustres</div>
      <div class='line'>Avertunt somnos.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The frog’s is a somnolent voice if heard at
a proper distance. One should not expect
harmony from wind instruments in the first
row of the orchestra chairs. If one’s frogs
annoy one, he should remove his swamp
or his house. The orchestra of Nature calls
for its bassoon and its cymbals—the bullfrog
and the cicada.</p>
<p class='c001'>A new poet has recently appeared in the
Dominion. Among his many poems of
pronounced freshness and beauty is one on
the frog—more strictly speaking, five poems,
for the panegyric consists of five connected
sonnets. Not alone does this graceful
lyrist and keen interpreter of Nature place
the frog as the grand diurnal musician of
spring, but he accords him a no less exalted
place as a soothing minstrel of the estival
night. I should be guilty of ingratitude to
my resonant friend of the swamp did I not
append the fourth sonnet of the musical
quintet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

      <div class='line'>And when day passed and over heaven’s height,</div>

IF my rugs and porcelains are a
study and delight in color, what
shall I say of my books, these
manifold colors and hues of the
mind that rejoice the inward
eye? When what François de Sales terms
a “dryness of soul” comes over me, are
not the genii of the library alway ready to
instruct and charm? Not a myth, but a
reality is the fabled lamp of Aladdin, luminous
still on many an immortal author’s
page.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“<i>Un bon feu, des livres, et des plumes,
que de ressources contre l’ennui!</i>” exclaims
De Maistre. With a well-chosen
library, even sickness loses its sting, and
often a good book may prove a more efficient
remedial agent than a physician’s
draught. Somewhere among the volumes
there exists a balm for nearly every ill—books
to stimulate and books to soothe,
books for instruction and books for <i>ennui</i>.
Every mood of the mind should be reflected
from the library shelves, just as Bacon holds
it that in the royal ordering of gardens
there ought to be gardens for every month
in the year. Books there should be in
abundance that may be read again and
again; books that may be taken in installments,
every page of each one of which is
a golden page; books to pore over as a miser
conns his gold; books to be dipped into, or
looked at “with half-shut eyes.” From
each page or each chapter of a good book
there should be extracted a beautiful thought,
as the wind in passing through a wood
draws from each tree a musical note. That
we possessed the memory of Scheherazade
and could remember the books we have
read!</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt, books are the great instructors,
though Gautier’s idea is an excellent
one, that each college possess a well-equipped
ship to make the voyage around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the world to read the universal book, the
best written book of all. Unfortunately,
every one may not sail round the world,
but very many of us must be content, like
De Maistre, with a voyage around our
room. And wise, far-seeing Pascal long
ago told us that nearly all our troubles arose
from our not knowing how to remain in
our own room. Perhaps, on the whole,
this is among the pleasantest ways of journeying.
You have but to step on board
one of the numerous crafts in waiting, and
with no further trouble than that of turning
over the pages, set sail for any port of the
universe. All this with a merely nominal
price for passage, and relieved of every discomfort
of travel.</p>

<p class='c001'>May I not, with Symonds, muse upon
the staircase of the Propylæa and wander
through the theatre of Dionysus? Do I
not visit the most romantic of all castles
with Thomson? and what wood so cool
and shadowy to stroll in as the forest of
Arden? With Jennings I ramble among
the Derbyshire hills and breast the breeze
of the Sussex Downs; with Hamerton I
float down the Unknown River; and with
Higginson rock in a wherry and lounge
about the Oldport wharves. Arm in arm
with sweet Mariette, Murger again leads me
through the Latin Quarter and the old lilac-scented
gardens of the Luxembourg. Reposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in my easy chair, I may almost
make the tour of the world in the sprightliest,
most instructive company it is possible
to imagine—Dumas <i>père</i>, in his inimitable
Impressions de Voyage, is my guide, philosopher,
and friend. The delightful dinners
he invites me to, the delicious wines he
sets before me, the sparkling anecdotes
that are ever bubbling from his entrancing
pen! I mount his easy Pegasus with De
Amicis, and exchange the blinding snow for
soft Andalusian sunshine. What an entertaining
<i>raconteur</i> I have in Francis Francis
to explain the traditions of manor and castle,
and discourse upon British scenery; and
what lovely trout I catch when, rod in
hand, I follow him By Lake and River!
Hawthorne raises his wand, and I am sauntering
through the Borghese gardens. With
Jefferies I accompany lovely Amaryllis at
the Fair; and with Robinson I wander
through an Indian Garden and listen to the
bulbul’s song. There is no dust, the
sun does not glare, I require no waterproof
or courier in these easy voyages. I turn
the enchanted pages, and the sun shines for
me at just the right angle. My rambles
never fatigue, however long the lane or
steep the hillside. I need not worry over
the arrival or departure of trains, dispute
with landlords, or bother with luggage. At
a signal, my ship is in waiting, ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>stop at the port I designate; in an hour a
smooth roadbed carries me across a kingdom,
without a delay, without a jar. There
can be nothing more delightful than these
imaginary journeys.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The ever-widening realm of books!”
Over two centuries ago, echoing the voice
of the ancients, Henry Vaughan decried
against their constantly increasing multitude:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>... As great a store</div>
      <div class='line'>Have we of books as bees of herbs, or more;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the great task to try, then know the good,</div>
      <div class='line'>To discern weeds and judge of wholesome food,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a rare scant performance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>What a sifting there must be among them
some day, as the volumes continue to accumulate—the
mediocre cast aside to make
room for the meritorious! Will there not
eventually be some invention to preserve old
books, an enamel for musty tomes, as wood
is vulcanized or bodies are embalmed? Or
must many works now existing in numerous
volumes be reduced to extracts to find
shelf-room for them all?</p>
<p class='c001'>But to those who may be anxious regarding
the accumulation of books, De
Merrier offers this consolation: “The indefatigable
hand of the grocers, the druggists,
the butter merchants, etc., destroy as many
books and <i>brochures</i> daily as are printed;
the paper-gatherers come next; and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>these hands, happily destructive, preserve
the equilibrium. Without them the mass
of printed paper would increase to an inconvenient
degree, and in the end chase all
the proprietors and tenants out of their
houses. The same proportion is to be observed
between the making of books and
their decomposition as between life and
death—a balm I address to those that the
multitude of books worries or grieves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What works will survive, and what
books shall we read? “If the writers of
the brazen age are most suggestive to thee,
confine thyself to them, and leave those of
the Augustan age to dust and the bookworms,”
says the transcendentalist of Walden.
“Something like the woodland
sounds,” the same author observes, “will
be heard to echo through the leaves of a
good book. Sometimes I hear the fresh
emphatic note of the oven-bird and am
tempted to turn many pages; sometimes
the hurried chuckling sound of the squirrel
when he dives into the wall.” “In science
read by preference the newest works; in
literature the oldest. The classic literature
is always modern. New books revive and
redecorate old ideas; old books suggest
and invigorate new ideas,” says Bulwer.
For knowledge of the world and literature,
for polished grace of diction, for elevated
and refined thought, and for the rhythm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>beautiful prose, Bulwer might have called
attention to his own essays, individual in
the language. The publisher is yet to be
thanked who will present Life, Literature,
and Manners in a worthy and convenient
form.</p>

<p class='c001'>We read and learn and forget from the
classics and the modern novelist as well.
I sometimes wonder how posterity will
regard the great writers of the present
generation—whether Holmes will hold a
more exalted place a century hence, or the
Scarlet Letter fade. Will a mightier
Shakespeare rise, and a sweeter Tennyson
sing? And instead of sending posterity to
Addison and Goldsmith for beautiful style,
will the twenty-first century mentor refer
the reader to a Spectator of an age that is
yet to dawn?</p>

<p class='c001'>The multitude of books one should
read! It takes one’s breath away to think
of the titles. They are as innumerable as
the buttercups of the meadow. Think of
them! the miles and leagues of folios,
quartos, octavos, duodecimos, 16, 18, 24,
and 32 mos. on every conceivable subject that
are sent out every year! The rows and
rows of shelves, fathoms deep, of old books
in numberless editions, cut and uncut, in
cloth, parchment, sheep, pigskin, and calf,
reposing in the book-stalls and libraries!
Books grave and gay, comic and serious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>storehouses of knowledge that are constantly
shifting hands; others precious beyond
price that are buried out of sight,
their beautiful thoughts unread! The tons
and tons of printed pages, in poetry and
prose, awake and asleep in the public and
private libraries of the great cities! They
are as clover-tops in a field.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The best hundred books!” Who shall
single them out from the mighty multitude?
It is like attempting to name the most
beautiful flower, the most lovely woman—no
one may know them all, and every one
has his preferences. In life, art, and the
study of literature it is at best a difficult
question to point out the right way, as
there are numerous considerations which
require to be left largely to the discrimination
of the person most concerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>To decide on the merits of a work one
may not take another’s opinion; one must
needs read, mark, and digest it for himself.
The reader who blindly submits to the dictum
of another rarely does so to advantage.
Far better to please one’s self and scout the
arbiters. Every person should form his
own estimate of the merits or demerits of a
work. When Robert Buchanan terms the
author of such exquisite verse as Les Tâches
Jaunes, and such finished prose as La Morte
Amoureuse “a hair-dresser’s dummy of a
stylist,” how is one to be governed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>choice of his reading, save from the standpoint
of his own taste! Because Sir Oracle
admires Gil Blas and the Pantagruel, is
no reason why you should do so, and because
a Taine may proclaim Pope a purloiner
and a mere juggler of phrase it does
not necessarily follow that the Essay on
Man is not one of the brightest jewels of
the language. Wisest is he who maps
out his own course of study and reading.
The predication of others can not make
that pleasing to him which is in utter variance
to his tastes and sympathies. “A
literary judgment is generally supposed to
be formed by canons of criticism,” remarks
Van Dyke, “but the canons are generally
individual canons, and the criticism is but
the synonym of a preference.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Often the bell-wether leads the flock
astray. Carlyle would have had A Midsummer
Night’s Dream written in prose,
and declared that Tennyson wrote in verse
because the schoolmaster had taught him it
was great to do so, and had thus been
turned from the true path for a man.
Emerson was always interested in Hawthorne’s
fine personality, but could not
appreciate his writings, while, equally
strange, the author of the exquisite Prose
Idyls extols the labored Recreations of
North. Holmes “never felt to appreciate
Irving as the majority look upon him,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>thinks the Sketch-Book “an overrated
affair.” Fitzgerald did not like In Memoriam,
The Princess, or The Idyls, and wished
there were nothing after the 1842 volume.
In Memoriam has the air, he says, of being
evolved by a poetical machine of the very
highest order. Voltaire thought the Æneid
the most beautiful monument which remains
to us of all antiquity. Peignot, in his
erudite Traité du Choix des Livres, terms
the Georgics the most perfect poem of
antiquity, thereby echoing the opinion of
Montaigne, who pronounced it “the most
accomplished peece of worke of Poesie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Edmund Gosse finds Tristram Shandy
dull; Bulwer asserts that only writers the
most practiced could safely venture an occasional
restrained imitation of its frolicsome
zoneless graces. Possibly Horace Walpole
comes nearer the mark in referring to it as
a very insipid and tedious performance,
though he might have defined it as a remarkable
work on obstetrics.</p>

<p class='c001'>Skipping Don Quixote and the Vicar of
Wakefield, and not having read Die Wahlverwandtschaften,
Jane Eyre, My Novel,
Rob Roy, The Three Musketeers, The Scarlet
Letter, Charles O’Malley, and how
many others! La Harpe terms Tom Jones
“the foremost novel of the world” (<i>le premier
roman du monde</i>). So, I believe,
does Lowell. Wilkie Collins, shortly before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>his death, gave the honor to The Antiquary.
The same renowned critic (La
Harpe), considered the Divine Comedy “a
stupidly barbarous amplification” (<i>une amplification
stupidement barbare</i>); Mézières,
another French critic, thinks it deserves to
be termed “the epopee of Christian peoples”
(<i>elle mérite d’être appelée l’épopée
des peuples chrétiens</i>).</p>

<p class='c001'>“We read the Paradise Lost as a task,”
growls Dr. Johnson. “Nay, rather as a
celestial recreation,” whispers Lamb. “I
would forgive a man for not reading Milton,”
Lamb naïvely adds, “but I would
not call that man my friend who should be
offended with the divine chit-chat of Cowper.”
Again, though I myself may see
much to praise but less to please in Paradise
Lost, infinitely preferring Lycidas, the
Allegro, and the Penseroso, I may, nevertheless,
admire Lamb; and though I may
recognize the worth of Mézières, I may dislike
the Divine Comedy. All of us may
not care for the Pilgrim’s Progress or
Hudibras; and some may prefer Cellini’s or
Rousseau’s autobiography to Boswell’s biography,—it
is not always so easy to read
and admire the books one should read and
admire from another’s standpoint.</p>

<p class='c001'>What two persons look at things precisely
the same? Human thought and human
opinion are as varied as the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of the human face. “There never was in
the world two opinions alike, no more than
two hairs or two grains. The most universal
quality is diversity,” observes Montaigne.
“An opinion,” says the sparkling
author of Bachelor Bluff, “is simply an angle
of reflection, or the facet which one’s individuality
presents to a subject, measuring
not the whole or many parts of it, but the
dimensions of the reflecting surface. It is
something, perhaps, if the reflection within
its limits is a true one.” There are particular
writers that, never widely popular, will
always have their particular admirers, and
we all of us have our special subjects or
predilections that we wish to know most
about, or are most interested in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>L’histoire c’est mo gibier en matière
des liures, ou la poësie que i’ayme d’vne
particulière inclinatio</i>” (history is my
game in the chase for books, or poetry,
which I especially dote upon), again observes
Montaigne. Montaigne is so quaint
he should be mused over in an old edition;
it is like gathering mushrooms from an old
pasture on a hazy autumn day. Plainly, it
is out of the question to read everything
even on a single subject, and many good
books are practically unattainable. The
Book-Worm, perched upon his ladder with
a duodecimo in one hand, a quarto under
his arm, and a folio between his knees, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>at least four sealed volumes. Each person
will read preferably such books as are in
keeping with his tastes and line of thought,
though he will greatly stimulate and enlarge
his thought by also reading books diametrically
opposed to his taste. The somewhat
prosy mind will be benefited by familiarity
with the poets; the super-poetic is improved
by the balance and adjustment to be found
in the study of works of reason and criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even then we may not read “the
best hundred books” of some one else’s
choosing. “We are happy from possessing
what we like, not from possessing what
others like,” La Rochefoucauld remarks;
and his maxim is pertinent to the library.
Tastes will ever differ in books and in bindings,
in epics and in lyrics. Many nice
people one knows, but one has not the
time, neither does one care to make bosom
friends of them all. Or, to cite Goldsmith,
“Though fond of many acquaintances, I desire
an intimacy only with a few.” Seldom
do we admire in age that which captivates
us in youth, and that which moves us in
one mood may not appeal to us in another.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most omnivorous book-worm can
read comparatively little. Those who read
slowly and digest what they read—if there
is time in life to read slowly—may read still
less. There is much in Bulwer’s sentence:
“Reading without purpose is sauntering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>not exercise. More is got from one book
on which the thought settles for a definite
end than from libraries skimmed over by a
wandering eye. A cottage garden gives
honey to the bee, a king’s garden none to
the butterfly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A happy remark with reference to the
best-hundred-books controversy is that
credited to Herman Merivale-“those
books which everybody says everybody
else must read, but never reads himself.”
“We praise that which is praised much
more than that which is praisable,” is a
pithy saying of La Bruyère. Charles Lamb
included in his catalogue of “<i>books which
are no books</i> generally all those volumes
which ‘no gentleman’s library should be
without.’” The author of that delicious
anonymity, A Club of One (A. P. Russell),
the failure to read which should send
the delinquent to Coventry, is more of a
philosopher than many of the professed literary
law-givers. It is true he presents a
list of his favorite books, but the list numbers
considerably over two hundred, and
these are delicately suggested, and not dictated
in a perfunctory way; I have no doubt
he has since added two hundred more. He
must have read and remembered ten times
a hundred to write the volume in question,
and ransacked whole libraries to compose
the companion volumes, Library Notes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>In a Club Corner, veritable mines of sparkling
sayings, sententious precepts, and literary
anecdote.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dana and Johnson have selected Fifty
Perfect Poems with excellent judgment, no
doubt, though who was responsible for the
insertion of numbers forty-three and fifty is
not stated in the preface. The Elegy, the
Ode on a Grecian Urn, The Lotus Eaters,
and a half-dozen other selections every one
must have included in a similar collection.
But beyond this dozen or so of immortal
poems that by no possibility might be omitted,
it is safe to say that almost any other
anthologist would have gathered <i>Chrysanthema</i>
totally different—so varied are individual
tastes both in poetry and prose.
The fifty best poems and the hundred best
books to Dobson may not be the hundred
best books and the fifty best poems to Gosse
or Lang. The marvel is how Johnson and
Dana could agree.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scholar and the student who live for
their books, the author, the man of elegant
leisure, or the bibliophile may be benefited
by a very large library, and share their benefits
with the world; though there is often no
little truth in what Gérard de Nerval said of
the latter in a perverted sense of the term:
“A serious bibliophile does not share his
books; he does not even read them himself
for fear of fatiguing them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“The amateur is born,” Derome goes
on to say in Le Luxe des Livres; “he holds
the Muses captive. If books could speak
they would pronounce him a hard jailer.
The bibliophiles ruin themselves in their
calling, neglecting their duties to their families.
Such are not men of letters, they are
<i>bibliotaphes</i>. They bury their books, they
do not possess them.... The luxury of
bindings is extended to profusion. It is the
<i>fête</i> of red morocco and tawny calf.” La
Rousse thus defines the term bibliotaphe:
“From the Greek <i>biblion</i>, book; <i>taphô</i>, I inter,
I hide. 1. He who lends his books to
no one, who buries them, inters them in his
library. 2. A reserved portion of a library
where precious works or works that one
does not wish to communicate are locked
up.” Nodier made still another discrimination,
that of the <i>bibliophobe</i> whom he thus
describes: “The <i>bibliophobe</i> would see
nothing out of the way in burning libraries.
He sells the copies that are dedicated to
him, and <i>does not return the service</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Between the <i>bibliophile</i> and the <i>bibliomane</i>
Nodier draws this distinction: “The
bibliophile chooses his books, the bibliomane
entombs them; the bibliophile appreciates,
the other weighs; the bibliophile has
a magnifying glass, the other a fathom
measure.” But the close consanguinity
which exists between the book-lover and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the book-collector; the narrow strip dividing
<i>terra firma</i> from the dangerous marsh
ever lighted by <i>ignes-fatui</i> that lure the
pursuer on and on, is well defined by Burton
in the introduction to The Book Hunter,
where, referring to the class for whom the
volume was written, he finds it difficult to
say whether he should give them a good
name or a bad, whether he should characterize
them by a predicate eulogistic or a
predicate dyslogistic.</p>

<p class='c001'>We all know of the man who paid a
fabulous sum for a copy of a very rare work,
only to consign it to the flames on receiving
it, in order that his own copy might
have no duplicate. This is an exceptional
form of the bibliolythist, or book-burner.
Among this class are included authors
ashamed of their first writings, authors who
have changed their political or religious
views, or who have eulogized a friend who
has become a bitter enemy. There exists
another form of the bibliolythist which Fitzgerald
has omitted from his Romance of
Book-Collecting—the “burking” of a work
by one who has been assailed. I know of a
standing offer from a gentleman of three dollars
apiece for every copy that booksellers
send him of a certain volume which retails
for a fifth of the price. The work contains
a reflection on one of his ancestors, and as
soon as the volumes are received they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>burned. But the book-burner is by no
means a modern institution, Nero and Caliph
Omar still remaining the greatest of bibliolythists.</p>

<p class='c001'>I would suggest as another desirable
term to add to the lexicon of the bibliopholist
the term <i>bibliodæmon</i>, or book-fiend—a
designation expressive of something more
than the ordinary significance of “book-borrower,”
innocent enough, no doubt, in
some of his milder forms, but exasperating
to the last degree in his most depraved
phases. The borrowing of a reference book
or a volume, a chapter or a page of which
may touch upon a subject that one desires
to consult merely for the time being, is a
matter apart. So also is the exchange of
books between friends, or the borrowing
of a work not readily procurable, the recipient
on his part standing ready to return the
courtesy, and forthwith restoring the volume
unsullied.</p>

<p class='c001'>Promptness in returning and scrupulous
care of a volume are the tests which distinguish
the comparatively harmless form
of the borrower from the aggravated and
exasperating one. The miserly practice of
borrowing books, books from which the
well-to-do borrower seeks to derive pleasure
or benefit without returning a just
equivalent, simply to shirk the trifling cost
of the volume he covets, deserves the severest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>stricture. Such are library dead-heads
and defaulters to publishers and authors.
It is this form of the bibliodæmon
who retains desumed copies for an indefinite
period, trusting the loan may be forgotten;
and who, deaf to all ordinary appeals
and reminders, only relinquishes the
volume—frequently maltreated—when virtually
wrested from him at his home. The
celebrated French bibliophile Pixérécourt
had inserted on the frontal of his library-case
these pertinent lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tel est le triste sort de tout livre prêté:</div>
      <div class='line'>Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est gâté.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Each book that’s loaned the same sad fate o’ertakes—</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis either lost or sent back with the shakes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There really exists no reason why books
should be loaned—there are always the public
libraries in which the borrower may ply
his trade.</p>
<p class='c001'>A former shepherd of the printed flocks
in the library of a neighboring town relates
an incident illustrating a singular form of
book borrowing, the offender being a divine.
Passionately fond of books, he would
take them home, forgetting to return them,
and when interrogated would always find a
happy excuse, the store of borrowed books
meanwhile accumulating. “A scholar and
a man of exemplary character and fine
sensibilities, I did not wish to wound his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>feelings by an imperative demand, being
convinced from what I knew of him, that
it was a slight lesion rather than a fracture
of the mind which caused the delinquency.
I therefore awaited his departure, and one
morning, driving to his home with a buggy
and a basket, I took possession of the borrowed
volumes. He never referred to it. I
do not think he even missed them. His
passion was the joy of first readings, and

IT was held by Disraeli that literature
is in no wise injured by
the bibliophile, since though the
worthless may be preserved,
the good is necessarily protected,
he no doubt having in mind the death
of the collector and subsequent sale of his
library. For though the bibliophile may
stint his family and hoard his golden leaves
and tooling, at least he abhors dog’s-ears and
keeps his treasures clean. La Bruyère, who
gave us the delightful maxim, “We only
write in order to be heard, but in writing we
should only let beautiful things be heard,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>referred to these accumulations as “tanneries,”
condemning fine bindings, one of the
few false dogmas uttered by the sprightly,
entertaining author of Les Caractères. Fine
bindings not only preserve but beautify fine
books; and to the sentiment of La Bruyère
I prefer that of Jules Janin: “<i>Il faut à
l’homme sage et studieux un tome honorable
et digne de sa louange.</i>” (“The wise
and studious man should have a volume
worthy of his praise.”)</p>

<p class='c001'>In Edouard Rouveyre’s instructive and
beautifully-printed manual on bibliography,
the question of bindings is summed up in
a sentence, fine bindings naturally referring
to books that are worthy of beautiful and
permanent coverings: “Binding is to typography
what this is to the other arts; the
one transmits to posterity the works of the
scholar, the other preserves the typographical
production for him.... The binding
of the amateur,” he continues, “should be
rich without ostentation, solid without
heaviness, always in harmony with the
work that it adorns, of great finish in its
workmanship, of exact execution in the
smallest details, with neat lines, and a
strongly conceived design.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c022'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Connaissances Nécessaires à un Bibliophile, par
Edouard Rouveyre, Troisième Edition. Paris, Ed. Rouveyre
et G. Blond, 1883, 2 vols.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“The binding of a book,” the Right
Honorable W. E. Gladstone succinctly observes,
“is the dress with which it walks
out into the world. The paper, type, and
ink are the body in which its soul is domiciled.
And these three, soul, body, and
habiliment, are a triad which ought to be
adjusted to one another by the laws of harmony
and good sense.” Nor should the
book-lover neglect to carry out the rules
relative to binding laid down by Octave
Uzanne in his Caprices d’un Bibliophile:
“A book should be bound according to its
spirit, according to the epoch in which it
was published, according to the value you
attach to it and the use you expect to make
of it; it should announce itself by its exterior,
by the gay, striking, lively, dull, somber,
or variegated tone of its accoutrement.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With regard to the book-cases themselves,
their height should depend upon
that of the ceilings, and on the number of
one’s volumes. For classification and reference,
it is more convenient to have numerous
small cases of similar or nearly similar
size and the same general style of construction
than a few large cases in which everything
is engulfed. With small or medium-sized
receptacles, each one may contain volumes
relating to certain departments or
different languages, as the case may be; by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>this means a volume and its kindred may be
readily found. Thus one, or a portion of
one, may be devoted to bibliography, another
to the philosophers, another to poetical
works, another to foreign literature, another
to reference works, another to books
relating to nature, art, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The style and color of the bindings,
also, may subserve a similar purpose; as,
for instance, the poets in yellow or orange,
books on nature in olive, the philosophers
in blue, the French classics in red, etc.
Unless methodically arranged, even with a
very small library, a volume is often difficult
to turn to when desired for immediate
consultation, requiring tedious search, especially
if the volumes are arranged upon
the shelves with respect to size and outward
symmetry. This may be avoided by
the use of small book-cases and a defined
style of binding. I refer to the general
style of binding; variety in bindings is
always pleasing, and very many books one
procures already bound and wishes to retain
in the original covers. Books, moreover,
which are in constant or frequent use
should not be placed in too tender colors.
Volumes become virtually lost and inaccessible
in the vast walnut sarcophagi in which
they are frequently entombed, and lose
the attractive look they possess when more
compactly enshrined. Above all things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the book-case should be artistic, artistically
plain, except for the richness of the carving.
Black walnut I should banish, unless employed
exclusively for somber old folios, to
accentuate their antiquity. Neither the
library nor the study should appear morose
or exhale an atmosphere of gloom.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a room ten and a half to eleven feet
high, five feet is a desirable height for the
book-cases. Besides the drawers at the
base, this will afford space for four rows of
books, to include octavos, duodecimos, and
smaller volumes. In some of the cases
three shelves may be placed—the shelves,
of course, should be shifting—to include
folios, large quartos, and octavos. Where
the ceilings are twelve feet high, six feet is
a better proportion, this height affording
five or four shelves, according to the size of
the volumes. By leaving the top of the
book-case twelve to thirteen inches wide,
ample space will be allowed for additional
small books, porcelains, and <i>bric-à-brac</i>.
It must be borne in mind that tall book-cases,
in addition to the inaccessibility of
the volumes on the upper shelves, leave
little if any space for pictures on the walls
above them; and that, though books assuredly
furnish and lend an air of refinement
to an apartment, they still require the relief
and complement of other decorative objects.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The cultured business man who may
have the taste but lacks the time for extensive
reading, the average man or woman
who reads for recreation, may derive more
benefit from a small library comprised of the
best books carefully chosen than from the
average large library. “<i>Quid prosunt innumerabiles
libri quorum dominus vix totâ
vitâ suâ indices perlegit?</i>” (“Of what use
is an innumerable quantity of volumes whose
owner may scarcely read the titles during his
lifetime?”) Seneca justly reasoned. It is not
so much the dinner of innumerable courses
as a few dishes well prepared. Except to
those who read quickly and assimilate readily,
the large library is apt to consist for the
most part of “uncut edges” in the layman’s
sense of the term.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good library is rarely suddenly formed.
Moreover, if it could be, it were not half as
satisfactory as a library added to by degrees,
the growth and gradual increase of years.
Again, some of the works that were considered
a rare treat half a century since are
no longer a treat to-day. They have become
old-fashioned in the same sense as a
garment. The critical eighteenth-century
essay in its entirety, the old style metaphysical
airing of some pet hobby, or didactic
wool-drawing now seem rather ponderous
productions. At present one does not even
care to read all of the joint productions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Addison and Steele (particularly the latter’s
essays), an averment that would have
placed one under a ban twenty years ago.
Yet even in Johnson’s day the Rambler was
more extolled than perused, the publisher
complaining that the encouragement as to
sale was not in proportion to the raptures
expressed by those who read it.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the increasing pyramids of books,
selection must become proportionately more
and more restricted. Equally is this the case
with poetry. Many of the ancient bards still
figure in the editions of the English poets—only
to sun their gilded backs on the library
shelves and seldom have their pages
turned. It were absurd to assert that the
Spectator and numerous other productions
of a former day will ever become closed
volumes. Curiosity, and their fame also,
would always cause them to be read by
futurity did not their merit preclude the
possibility of their ever sinking into oblivion.
It is very probable, however, that at
no distant day many of the immortals will
exist in abridged editions. Some authors,
like Montaigne, on the other hand, can
never be cut down; their redundancies and
embroideries are their charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>To our forefathers time was more
lenient than it is to us. Somehow the
days and the nights were longer, and the
old-time reader appeared to find more leisure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and a brighter oil with which to pursue his
literary browsings and point his antitheses.
“There is a certain want of ease about the
old writers,” Alexander Smith remarks
(and I recall no one who has expressed it
so musically before), “which has an irresistible
charm. The language flows like a
stream over a pebbled bed, with propulsion,
eddy, and sweet recoil—the pebbles, if retarding
movement, giving ring and dimple
to the surface and breaking the whole into
babbling music.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I looked into one of these old
volumes,” Thoreau characteristically says,
“it affected me like looking into an inaccessible
swamp, ten feet deep with sphagnum,
where the monarchs of the forest,
covered with mosses and stretched along
the ground, were making haste to become
peat. Those old books suggested a certain
fertility, an Ohio soil, as if they were making
a <i>humus</i> for new literatures to spring
in. I heard the bellowing of bull-frogs
and the hum of mosquitoes reverberating
through the thick embossed covers when I
had closed the book. Decayed literature
makes the richest of all soils.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In this age of hurry and concentration
who has the time to wade through the hundred
volumes of Voltaire? It is even a task
to go through his anthology, Élite de Poésies
Fugitives, in the pretty little two-volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Cazin edition, there are so many more
shells than pearls. But one’s time is well
repaid after all, if only for the sake of finding
and holding one such exquisite bit of
airy verse as M. Bernard’s Le Hameau. Is
it original, or a translation? The German
poet Gottfried Bürger’s Das Doerfchen and
this are one and the same, except that the
latter is somewhat condensed, though
equally beautiful. Following M. Bernard’s
idyl is a panegyric in verse by Voltaire addressed
to M. Berger, “who sent him the
preceding stanzas,” Voltaire’s tribute beginning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>De ton Bernard</div>
      <div class='line'>J’aime l’esprit.</div>
      <div class='line'>C’est la peinture</div>
      <div class='line'>De la nature.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Bernard, Berger, and Bürger; or Bürger,
Berger, and Bernard would at first sight
seem to be in a tangle. But in rendering to
Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I praise my dear</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet village here,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>undoubtedly should be returned to the German
poet.</p>
<p class='c001'>In the case of nearly every prolific author
some few volumes represent his finest
thought. I grant every one has or should
have a favorite author, one who stands to
him on a higher pedestal than all others,—an
author whom he reveres and loves, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>who must be read in every line that was
the emanation of his brain. But for one to
read every page of Thackeray, Bulwer,
Goethe, Dumas, and the host of celebrated
romancists, poets, essayists, and philosophers,
delightful and instructive though
they be, is a simple impossibility.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to the change in literary taste,
and to instance a marked example, consider
Wilson, or Christopher North. “Fusty
Christopher,” Tennyson termed this pompous
<i>arbiter elegantiarum</i>. The tables have
been turned since the editor of Blackwood
reviled the poet-laureate, and the animus of
the criticism on Tennyson might now be
applied to its stultified author. What
magazine of the present could be induced
to publish North’s rhapsodies? An installment
would seriously damage The Atlantic,
Scribner’s, or even Maga itself. How tiresome
his ceaseless alliteration, his deluge of
adjectives, his stream of similes, his invective,
his bathos!</p>

<p class='c001'>Many portions of the Noctes, it is true,
are marvels of imagination and erudition,
and some of his angling conceits are worthy
of Norman MacLeod. Others, especially
his selections as collected and published by
himself under the title of The Recreations,
are crusted over with algæ of self-conceit.
It is the peacock who consciously struts.
Pepys’s reiterated “I” and quaint egotism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>are never tiresome; Wilson’s pompous
first person plural becomes a weariness.
They used to give us Baxter’s Saints’ Rest to
parse, in the olden school days, and I could
not help but think that if the saints had
such a horrible time, how fortunate it was
we lived in a more advanced period. No
doubt the schoolmaster might have given
us worse books to parse; and, unquestionably,
we should be duly grateful that The
Recreations were not included. From the
<i>a priori</i> to the <i>a posteriori</i> would have been
so much harder sailing! Has not even the
long-spun panorama of The Seasons lost
something of its charm? Or, rather, should
it not be read in an old edition?</p>

<p class='c001'>Good editions of good books, though
they may often be expensive, can not be
too highly commended. One can turn to
a page in inviting letterpress so much easier
than to a page of an unattractive volume.
The fine shades of meaning stand out more
clearly, and the thought is revealed more
intelligibly when clothed in fitting typographical
garb. Often it becomes a positive
labor to follow many a pleasing author
in the small or worn types and poor paper
with which the publisher mercilessly
thrusts him into the world. The reader
has virtually to work his passage through
the pages and take frequent rests by the
way.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Poor illustrating is even worse. Who
may appreciate the beauties of The Talking
Oak in the edition where Olivia is portrayed
in the act of kissing a giant bole whose
girth scarcely equals her own? One must
ever afterward associate an oak with a fat
Olivia. Apparently the artist never read
Sir Thomas Wyatt:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A face that should content me wondrous well</div>
      <div class='line'>Should not be fair, but lovely to behold,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>or William Browne:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What best I lov’de was beauty of the mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that lodgd in a Temple truely faire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>How dreadful, too, are many of the works
illustrated by Cruikshank and Crowquill,
which some profess to set such store by
because they are held at such a premium
by the book dealers!</p>
<p class='c001'>Nearly as reprehensible as poor illustrating
is pilloring the unfortunate author
in the stocks of some atrocious color that
must develop a cataract if gazed at long and
fixedly. “I have been well-nigh ruined by
the binder!” exclaimed one of the bright
writers and literarians of the day; and before
attempting to read one of his most entertaining
volumes I stripped it of its frightful
garb and clothed it in becoming attire.
Otherwise one might not follow the ideas, the
glaring blue and hideous figure of the original
cover asserted themselves so strongly.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>One should always endeavor to procure
a good edition to start with; it is inconvenient
to change editions. You come to associate
certain favorite passages of a well-conned
author with their place upon certain
pages, so that you may instantly turn to
them. The passages look strange to you
in strange types, and you almost require to
be introduced anew. With a change of
page the mere thought itself remains the
same, only it seems to have altered its expression.
Let those who will, prate about
a thought being a thought wherever it may
exist. Some thoughts there are so airy and
delicate they require to be read by one’s
self—they lose a portion of their fragrance
if repeated or obtained second hand. They
should be savored by the eye and heard
only by the inner ear. “The dark line”
of the sun-dial “stealing imperceptibly on—for
sweet plants and flowers to spring
by, for the birds to apportion their silver
warblings by, for flocks to pasture and be
led to fold by”—is more sharply defined
upon the page of The Old Benchers of the
Inner Temple, the page where I first saw
it, than it can ever appear to me upon any
other page. Again, many flowers one enjoys
most upon the uncut stalk. They may
not be plucked and retain the full aroma
they distill amid their natural surroundings.
So that a quoted sentence from want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>connection often loses much of the charm
it presents upon the author’s page. And
yet, on the other hand, quotation, when judiciously
employed, not unfrequently places
the author quoted in his most favorable
light, while forming equally a pleasing complement
to the page of the writer himself.
Montaigne’s <i>fleurons</i> of citation, woven
from his scholastic and inexhaustible loom,
what were the Essays without them?—limpid
brooks and springs ever pouring
their sparkling waters into the meandering,
smooth-flowing river of the text. Merely
by the change of type, quotation relieves
the monotony of the page, while, with
great writers, apt citation lends added emphasis
and beauty to the thought, just as
the art of damascening enriches a fine
blade.</p>

<p class='c001'>Good editions are everything in reading.
Even the fragrant mint of Lamb possesses
a heightened pungency to me when gathered
along the cool, broad margins of a London
imprint. Not only the mind through
the personality or charm of the thought expressed,
and the ear through the harmony
and lucidness of the style with which it is
uttered; but equally the eye, in the outward
garb with which the thought is clothed,
should be gratified in reading a beautiful
book. The printer it is who contributes
the finishing touches and heightens the reflective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>surface. Elia’s buoyant, playful
graces have, perhaps, received their most
exquisite and appropriate setting in the two
little volumes of the Temple Library, printed
by the Chiswick press, the smaller being
preferable to the large-paper edition.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is pleasant to have some authors both
in an early and a late edition. If I desire
the notes, the full-page illustrations, and an
amplified text, I choose the edition of The
Complete Angler illustrated by Stothard
and Inskipp and annotated by Sir Harris
Nicholas. If I wish to get still nearer Walton—to
hear more plainly his birds contending
with the echo, to pluck his culverkees
and ladysmocks, to smell his primroses,
and admire the very “shape and
enameled color of the trout it joyed him
so to look upon,” I read him in the old
spelling and old font of the fac-simile reprint
of the first edition. Moreover, for the
sake of making comparisons, it is often desirable
to have an early as well as a late
edition of a favorite author. So subtle, indeed,
are the niceties of reading they may
scarcely be defined. How delightful the
mere cutting of the edges of the book one
longs to read, and the occasional dip into
the pages as you turn the leaves!</p>

<p class='c001'>Of a few favorite authors it is desirable to
possess two copies, one in an inexpensive
form to take when traveling. A trunk-maker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>is yet to appear who will contrive an
apartment that will enable one to pack books
so they may receive no possible injury—the
one thing Addison’s Trunk-maker of the
Upper Gallery neglected. Besides, apart
from the friction in its receptacle, a valuable
book is liable to other injuries, or loss while
traveling. The traveling volume should be
small, securely bound, light in the hand,
and not too bulky for the pocket.</p>

<p class='c001'>But an old book of all books for true delight!
The pleasure of reading Chaucer or
Spenser is doubled by the types and the associations
of the past. The foxed and faded
pages are like the rust on antique bronzes,
the lichens on an old wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the preface to Wheatley’s The Dedication
of Books reference is made to this
fascination which is conferred by an ancient
font upon an ancient page. “There is,”
remarks the author, “a delicate flavor of
antiquity and a certain quaint charm in the
old print of the books from which many of
the dedications have been drawn that seems
to depart when the same sentences are
printed in modern type, and we are apt
sometimes to wonder what it was that we
originally admired. The bouquet has fled
while we were in the act of removing the
cork from the bottle.” Present, too, with
the charm of the olden page itself is the
thought of who may have first turned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>pages when the book you are reading was
in its fresh and spotless leaf, and whose
hand it was that traced the annotations
which embroider its margins.</p>

<p class='c025'>Singularly, the beautiful sonnet in which
these lines occur was one which had been
cast aside by Ronsard from the later editions
of his works, and was only reprinted
in Buon’s edition of 1609. Still more singular
it seems that the “Prince of Poets”
should have remained comparatively unappreciated
for two centuries until reintroduced
by St. Beuve. Am I mistaken in
thinking there is a pronounced resemblance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>between this sonnet and Shakespeare’s
“When I do count the clock that tells the
time”?</p>

<p class='c001'>Chaucer’s—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For tho’ we sleep, or wake, or rome, or ride,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>are as fine as any of the allusions by the
classic poets who have festooned and intertwined
the passing hour with rosebuds and
asphodels.</p>
<p class='c001'>I find the Book of Sun-Dials a delightful
volume to take up when in a meditative
mood. It needs, withal, a still room and
a still hour to be read in, an environing
quietness like the whisper of the gnomon
itself. Then rambling through the pages,
the present becomes absorbed by the past
as you muse over the icons of the dials and
moralize upon the quaint inscriptions.
Transcribed in large Italic type, the mottoes
stand out with the vividness of an epitaph
graven upon a tomb, voices from posterity
preaching from the perennial text:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As Time And Houres Passeth Awaye</div>
      <div class='line'>So Doeth The Life Of Man Decaye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Often as you contemplate the time-posts
and their <i>intaglios</i> do they absorb the attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>afresh, casting new shades of meaning
from the sentient styles. They transport
you into gardens where old-fashioned
flowers and historic yew-trees grow, they
conduct you through old churchyards among
neglected graves, they deliver their homilies
from weather-beaten walls, and their pathos
appeals from many an ancient sanctuary
and moss-grown lintel. How noiselessly,
how serenely they mark the flight of time!
It is Time itself inaudibly counting the
hours; the day suavely balancing its silent
periods. They mirror primitive time, removed
from the present turmoil, when the
sun was the pendulum and the shadow the
index-hand. Associated with Nature by
ties the most endearing, by the golden sunshine,
the murmuring breeze, and the songs
of birds, the dial becomes, as it were, a reflective
facet of external Nature in her gracious
moods, its very shadow representing
sunlight, the sunlight absent where the
shadow is not. The sun-dial has molded
itself to grace, and with rare exceptions its
mottoes are happily chosen, attesting hours
of meditation in forming an epigram or
shaping a poetic fancy to blend with the
shifting shadow. Certainly many of the
sentiments collated in the monograph referred
to are of more than passing interest.
Their pathos and their quaintness set one
dreaming.</p>
<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Among the many inscriptions which arrested
me while first turning the leaves, a
few may be appended without, I trust,
fatiguing the reader. Let her or him moralize
a moment, and consider life from the
standpoint of the dial, now grave, now gay;
now lively, now severe. Though Time
hurries mankind it has apparently not hurried
the dials in choosing their inscriptions.
It is rather a case of <i>festina lente</i> than <i>hora
fugit</i>. Some are as terse as an epigram
of Martial or a proverb from Job; others
sweet as a hymn of Watts or a stanza from
The Temple. Thus, light and shadow are
felicitously blended in the tale a dial tells
on a house at Wadsley, near Sheffield, the
moralist preaching from a niche in the wall:</p>

<p class='c021'>is inscribed on an old horologium in the Grey
Friars’ churchyard, Sterling.</p>
<p class='c001'>Sweetly fragrant are the lines incised on
the four sides of a stone dial in a flower-garden
at South Windleham:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I Stand Amid Ye Summere Flowers</div>

      <div class='line'>O Man Whose Flesh Is But As Grasse</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Summere Floweres Thy Life Shall Passe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Whiles Tyme Is Thine Laye Up In Store</div>
      <div class='line'>And Thou Shalt Live For Ever More.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Pretty, also, are the lines by James Montgomery
beneath a vertical dial in Burneston,
Yorkshire:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time From The Church Tower Cries To You And Me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon This Moment Hangs Eternity:</div>

      <div class='line'>Prepare To Meet It; Death Will Not Delay;</div>
      <div class='line'>Take Then Thy Saviour’s Warning—Watch And Pray!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>One of the mottoes has an echo of Sidney:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time As He Passes Us Has A Dove’s Wing</div>
      <div class='line'>Unsoiled And Swift, And Of A Silken Sound.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“The Night Cometh” is neatly amplified
upon a plate that supports a cross sun-dial
on a stone pedestal upon the terrace of the
hospital of St. Cross, Rugby:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The Passing Shadows Which The Sunbeams Throw</div>
      <div class='line'>Athwart This Cross, Time’s Hastening Foot-Steps Show;</div>
      <div class='line'>Warned By Their Teaching Work Ere Day Be O’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon Comes The Night When Man Can Work No More.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>One motto reads Unam Time (Fear one
hour); another, Unam Timeo (One hour I
fear). Two others read, Heu Quærimus
Umbram, Heu Patimus Umbram (Alas! we
pursue a shadow), (Alas! we endure the
shadow). Eheu Fugaces is marked upon a
Yorkshire plate, and Labuntur Anni on
Burnham Church, Somerset. The shortest
mottoes are Redeme, J’avance, Remember,
Irrevocabile. A beautiful stone sun-dial still
casts its shadow in the old garden of Gilbert
White, and is figured in Macmillan’s edition
of the Natural History of Selborne. This is
not mentioned in Mrs. Gatty’s comprehensive
work, and I can not determine from
the illustration whether it bears a motto.
Each To His Task, taken from White’s Invitation
would be an appropriate inscription.</p>
<p class='c001'>One of the quaintest inscriptions mentioned
in the Book of Sun-Dials is that which
looks from the wall of a church at Argentière,
near Vallouse. It was scarcely composed
in an hour, and loses much in the
translation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cette Montre Par Son Ombre Montre</div>
      <div class='line'>Que Comme L’Ombre Passent Nos Jours.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>(This marker marks by its shadow that
our days pass away like a shadow).</p>
<p class='c001'>There is much of moral coloring in these
two lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Haste Traveller, The Sun Is Sinking Low</div>
      <div class='line'>He Shall Return Again, But Never Thou.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And is this not altogether lovely?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Give God Thy Heart, Thy Hopes, Thy Gifts, Thy Gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Day Wears On, The Times Are Waxing Old.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>And so one might go on quoting the
old moral, shadowed by different texts.
Perhaps Sterne expresses it as pithily as
any epigrammatist, “life” being but another
term for time: “What is the life of
man! Is it not to shift from side to side?
from sorrow to sorrow? to button up one
cause of vexation, and unbutton another?”
But Sterne deals with the shadow only,
while the gnomon of the dial presents its
side of sunshine equally with its side of
shade, however somber the tone of the inscription.
Doubtless Nature preaches more
truly than man. Life is not all composed
of shadow, nor all of sunshine; and if we
but cultivate the spirit of contentment, possibly
we have solved its sternest problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>But may contentment, after all, be had
for the striving? “Whatever it be that
falleth into our knowledge and jouissance,”
reasons Montaigne in the fifty-third chapter
of the First Book, “we finde it doth not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>satisfie us, and we still follow and gape after
future, uncertaine, and unknowne things,
because the present and knowne please us
not, and doe not satisfie us. Not (as I
thinke) because they have not sufficiently
wherewith to satiate and please us, but the
reason is, that we apprehend and seize on
them with an unruly, disordered, and a
diseased taste and hold-fast.” And, again,
in the twelfth chapter of the Second Book:
“All of the Philosophers of all the sects that
ever were doe generally agree on this point,
that the chiefest felicitie, or <i>summum bonum</i>,
consisteth in the peace and tranquillitie of
the soul and bodie:—but where shall we
find it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Somewhere, slumbering upon the
shelves, there exists a golden book of a former
century, written by a learned French
philosopher-pantologist, entitled L’Art de se
rendre heureux par les Songes (The Art of
rendering one’s self happy by Dreams). A
unique volume and the labor of a lifetime,
its present owner and the fortunate possessor
of the secret has never been discovered;
and, alas! a reprint does not exist.
Contentment—is this but another name for
Illusion?—is a bird of passage who, soaring
high in the empyrean, must be secured on
the wing. Numberless those who would
ensnare him, and innumerable the lures set
to turn his evasive pinion. But he flies not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>in flocks; and, dimly outlined against the
distant sky, he is ever flitting onward, far
out of range. Some one, farther on, who
seeks him not, perchance looks serenely
upward, and unconsciously charms him
down....</p>

A CERTAIN selfish satisfaction I enjoy
in reading a fine limited edition
of a classic, or a choice
work that is difficult to procure.
It is like possessing a gem of an
uncommon color, a piece of old Chinese
glaze, or any rare art object. If the work
itself possess intrinsic value I am sure of my
investment, while I rejoice in its attractive
guise. Reading thus becomes more than
a pleasure; it is an exquisite luxury. I
marvel who secures all the “number 1’s”
of the large-paper editions. Some bibliotaphe
must have a monumental collection,
for nobody ever sees one.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“The passion for first editions, the purest
of all passions,” some one remarks. I
confess I do not share this passion in its intensity,
in all cases, unless the first edition
be superior in letterpress or form, or a later
edition has been altered, condensed, or enlarged
to its disadvantage. The classics in
first editions, and the “old melodious lays”
in first folios by all means, if you can afford
and procure them; Gibbon, Macaulay, Scott,
Dickens, and the rest of the historians and
novelists in the easiest, most attractive page
to read and hold in the hand, whatever the
edition. This with reference to literature
proper, and not to scientific works, of which
latter the latest edition is naturally to be
preferred.</p>

<p class='c001'>I sometimes find myself picturing the
author behind the page. Lang and Dobson,
are they as merry as the songs they
sing? Phil Robinson, is he half so pleasant
a companion in the flesh as on the
printed page? Bullen, who edits the old
poets with such consummate taste, is he as
jolly as the Elizabethan lyrics ever swarming
on the tip of his tongue? Higginson,
so tender and musical in his polished prose,
I wonder does he lose his temper when the
<i>sauce piquante</i> proves a failure? The brilliant,
entertaining philosopher of A Club of
One, is he philosophical enough to eschew
colchicum for his gout; and, I marvel, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>he enrolled among the Brotherhood of the
Merry Eye?</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the author is most charming,
for the most part, between the covers. On
paper he is always on his good behavior,
his personal facets shaped so as to catch the
most favorable light. Knowing him and
meeting him in every-day life you might
find him cold, arrogant, opinionated—an
altogether disagreeable companion. Forgetful
of the flight of time, he might be
prone to argument or backbiting. He
might be deaf or color-blind, and always
late at his engagements. He might be
constantly straddling a hobby-horse. He
might be an incorrigible whistler, or possess
an ungovernable temper. All his petty
weaknesses and foibles he conceals, or tries
to conceal, on the printed page.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, Joseph Boulmier:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oui, les hommes sont laids, mais leurs œuvres sont belles;</div>
      <div class='line'>Les hommes sont méchants, mais leurs livres sont bons.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Men are unlovely, but their works are fair—</div>
      <div class='line'>Ay, men are evil, but their books are good.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>If, as has been asserted, he is the best author
who gives the reader the most knowledge
and takes from him the least time,
surely the olive crown should be awarded
the composers of the compilations, the
digests, and the anthologies, often the fruit
of decades spent in poring over manuscripts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and print. Little do we consider
the pains they have cost. What an amount
of rummaging through faded manuscripts,
what ransacking of musty folios and plodding
through by-ways of the past has it
not required to produce Bullen’s smiling
volumes from the song-books, masques,
and pageants of the Elizabethan Age, and
his other rarer anthologies, Speculum Amantis
and Musa Proterva. The works themselves
of very many of the authors quoted
would be a veritable labor to wade through,
with few fragrant flowers of poesy to perfume
the way. All this the compiler spares
us, and with catholic taste gathers a blossom
here and a blossom there from the vast
fields of little-known song. Equally does
Mr. Bullen deserve the thanks of every
lover of lyric poetry for his collection of
Campion’s works, and the Chiswick press
the tribute of all admirers of beautiful printing
for the frame in which Campion’s
“golden cadence” has been set.</p>
<p class='c001'>By reading Hazlitt’s Gleanings in Old
Garden Literature I am saved the fatigue of
perusing countless uninteresting tomes on
the subject. He has extracted the honey
for me from innumerable flowers. Yet my
Parkinson, my Gerarde, my Evelyn, my
Bacon I must read between the lines myself;
it is to the dull books he has been the
bee for me. To gather the sweets is often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>a difficult and always a laborious task. Not
these plodding compilers, the class who are
referred to in the wise old precept, the
source of which I have never been able to
trace: “Those who do not practice what
they preach resemble those sign-posts in
the country which point out the weary way
to the traveler without taking the trouble
of traversing it themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Without doubt, among the most beloved
of books are those written for pure love of
the beautiful, distinct from literary ambition
or posthumous fame, especially when to
this is added a sympathetic, lucid, and unconscious
style, such as we love to linger
over in The Complete Angler or White’s
Selborne. Walton himself has epitomized
this charm in a line introductory to his angling
idyl: “I wish the reader also to take
notice that in the writing of it I have made
myself a recreation of a recreation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Johnson has said books that you may carry
to the fire and hold readily in your hand
are the most useful, after all. Before Johnson,
and long before printing was dreamed
of, an old Greek proverb held that a great
book was a great evil, and Martial wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Buy books that but one hand engage,</div>
      <div class='line'>In parchment bound, with tiny page.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Assuredly, the little book is a delight. It is
a joy in the hand when well bound, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>may serve to take the place of fire-arms in
a public conveyance where one otherwise
might find himself at the mercy of an uncongenial
or too loquacious passenger. But
the life of the library were dull were it confined
to the 18 and 24 mos. Let each
book and each subject have its appropriate
setting, and let there be variety of sizes.
The majesty of the shelves were fled without
the thick quarto and tall old folio.</p>
<p class='c001'>Apart from De Bury, Dibdin, Disraeli,
Burton, Didot, Janin, the bibliophile Jacob,
and other universally known bibliographical
writers, there are innumerable pleasant
books on books. Of such, in addition to
those previously alluded to, may be specified
Lang’s Books and Bookmen and The
Library; The Pleasures of a Bookworm and
The Diversions of a Bookworm, by J. Rogers
Rees, delightfully written volumes attractively
printed by Elliott Stock; Alexander
Ireland’s Book-Lover’s Enchiridion;
Saunder’s The Story of Some Famous
Books; Wheatley’s The Dedication of
Books, and How to form a Library, the
latter three volumes likewise daintily printed
by Elliott Stock in the series of The
Book-Lovers’ Library.</p>

<p class='c001'>In A Club Corner, by A. P. Russell, a volume
previously mentioned, is largely devoted
to books and authors. A store-house
of literary and bibliographical information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>exists between the covers of Library Notes,
and Characteristics, by the same author.
Books and how to use Them is the title of
an instructive and entertaining small duodecimo
by J. C. Van Dyke, librarian of the
Sage Library, New Brunswick, N. J., a
writer deep versed in books, but not shallow
in himself. Brander Mathews’s Ballads
of Books, or Lang’s recast of this volume,
is a most excellently chosen collection of
poems relating to books. Every one will
read with pleasure Percy Fitzgerald’s The
Book Fancier, or the Romance of Book-Collecting,
a work replete with curious information.
The French scholar has a host
of kindred works to choose from, all written
<i>de cœur</i>; for in France the passion for
books, book-collecting, fine letterpress, and
fine bindings exists to a greater degree
than anywhere else. It was a Frenchman,
the famed <i>bouquineur</i> Nodier, who worried
through life without a copy of Virgil “because
he could not succeed in finding the
ideal Virgil of his dreams.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What instructive, sparkling volumes are
these: L’Enfer du Bibliophile, Mes Livres,
Connaissances Nécessaires à un Bibliophile,
Derome’s Le Luxe des Livres and the two
beautifully-printed and entertaining volumes,
Causeries d’un Ami des Livres, Le
Petit’s L’Art d’Aimer les Livres, Peignot’s
Manuel du Bibliophile, Octave Uzanne’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Caprices d’un Bibliophile, Mouravit’s Petite
Bibliothèque d’Amateur, Jacob’s Les Amateurs
de Vieux Livres, and how many
more!</p>

<p class='c001'>I know of no more fascinating volume
of its class, however, than De Resbecq’s
Voyages Littéraires sur les Quais de Paris,
Paris, A. Durand, 1857. The contents are
in the form of letters from an indefatigable
hunter of the book-stalls along the Seine to
a fellow-bibliophile in the provinces. Daily,
through summer’s sun and winter’s cold,
he continues the chase, scenting the spoils
of the stalls like a harrier beating the ground
for game, chatting with the book dealers,
and philosophizing as he scans the volumes.
Among the many prizes which persistent
foragings secured was a copy of that rarest
of the Elzevirs, the Pastissier François.
The volume had been denuded of its covers,
but had the engraved title-page, the
celebrated <i>scène de cuisine</i> with the range,
the tables, the cooks, and the fowls entirely
intact. “The box in which this jewel reposed,
its interior in perfect preservation,
contained no price-mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘How much?’ said I to the merchant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Well, for you, six sous; is it too
dear?’”</p>

<p class='c001'>I recall few more delightful books for
the bibliophile than Jules Richard’s beautifully-printed
small volume L’Art de Former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>une Bibliothèque, published by Edouard
Rouveyre, Paris, 1883. His advice to the
collector, which terminates the preface, is
well worth transcribing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Always distrust your enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Distrust the enormous prices at which
certain original editions of secondary authors
are quoted. For acknowledged genius one
can afford to pay generously, but for the
others, how many disappointments the future
has in store!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never pay a high price for a book you
do not know.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verify the titles, the pagination, the
tables, and count the plates, if it is an illustrated
book.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same observation holds good for
editions on extraordinary paper of books
absolutely ordinary. Whatman and vellum
require to be well placed in order to sustain
their value.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One knows when he begins to collect,
one never knows when he will cease;
therein consists the pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A work of much interest is that of Philomeste
Junior (Gustave Brunet), published
in four small <i>brochure</i> volumes severally
entitled La Bibliomanie en 1878, 1880, 1881,
1883, ou Bibliographie Rétrospective des
Adjudications les Plus Remarquables faites
cette Année, et de la Valeur primitive de ces
Ouvrages. It is in France that bibliomania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>seems to have reached its apotheosis. La
Bibliomanie furnishes some interesting facts
with regard to the steady advance in the
prices of certain classes of French books.
“Fashion dictates her laws for the choice
of books as for the toilet of fashionable
ladies; they are without appeal.” To be
the happy possessor of a cabinet in which
are enshrined a dozen tomes of unexceptional
condition, illustrated by celebrated
eighteenth-century artists like Eisen, Gravelot,
Moreau, Marillier, and bound by Du
Seuil, Padeloup, Derome, or Trautz, calls
for an elastic portemonnaie.</p>

<p class='c001'>To cite a few examples of the advance
in French books, paralleled also in English
books, a copy of Manon Lescaut (1753)
sold in 1839 for 109 frs., in 1870 for 355
frs., in 1875 for 1,335 frs. The edition
of Montaigne’s Essays: Bourdens, S. Millanges,
1580, two parts in one octavo vol.,
sold for 24 frs., in 1784. The same copy
recently sold for 2,060 frs. Another edition
of the Essays, 1725, 3 vols. 4to, with
the arms of the Maréchal de Luxembourg,
brought 2,900 frs. for the “arms.” Still
another edition, Paris, 1669, 3 vols., 12mo,
a poor edition, brought 1,960 frs. at the
Cormon sale, Paris, 1883. It had the
stamp of the golden fleece, the insignia of
Longpierre, a mediocre poet, and the purchaser
paid for the fleece. The edition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>1595, Paris, chez A. l’Angelier, 1 vol., infol.
veau, brought 1,100 frs., in 1881. A
“clean and sound copy” of this edition in
the original calf was quoted in a recent
London catalogue at £12 12<i>s.</i>, another London
dealer pricing a copy of the same edition
soon afterward at £60.</p>

<p class='c001'>The edition of 1588, Paris, Abel l’Angelier,
in 4, mar., Du Seuil, was recently
quoted by Morgand who is termed <i>la
bourse des livres</i>, at 4,000 frs. This was
the last edition published during the author’s
lifetime, and the first to contain the third
book. It was marked on the frontispiece
“fifth edition,” though only three are
known to have preceded it. The library
of Bordeaux possesses an example of this
edition filled with annotations and corrections
by the hand of Montaigne. Up to the
present time, no editor of the Essais has
availed himself of these resources, of inestimable
value from the point of view of the
study of the text of Montaigne. It would
be of more than passing interest to know
whether in these corrections the author
mitigated his observation with regard to
authors correcting their work.</p>

<p class='c001'>A copy of the Pastissier François,
bound by Trautz, was purchased not long
since by a French amateur for 4,100 frs.
In 1883 a copy sold for 3,100 frs., at the
sale of M. Delestre-Cormon, Paris. “This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span><i>broché</i> copy, uncut (extremely rare in this
condition), cost its owner 10,000 frs.; it
has suffered a justifiable reduction. Despite
the entire absence of interest it presents,
this volume being the least known of
the Elzevir collection, it has often obtained
enormous prices, but they are not sustained;
it has been recognized that its rarity has
been exaggerated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the numerous causes, especially
in France, which operate in the value of a
volume are previous distinguished ownership,
and the garb of an illustrious binder.
In books the habit frequently makes the
“monk.” It is sufficient for a mediocre
work to be emblazoned with the crest of
Pompadour or to have been fingered by Du
Barry to make it worth its weight in gold.
All their <i>légèretés</i> are freely forgiven by the
bibliophile in view of the lovely bindings
with which they clothed their books. Of
recent years, as is well known, the Greek
and Latin classics have found far less favor
than they did a few years since. In France,
and equally in England, the craze is for first
editions of standard works, for rare works,
for works formerly belonging to some distinguished
personage, for rare or beautiful
bindings, and for special beauty of letterpress
or illustration.</p>

<p class='c001'>A late illustrated catalogue, issued by
Bouton, the New York bookseller, furnishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>some interesting facts with regard to
the increase in the price of books in this
country. If we consider the rapidly advancing
taste for literature in America, it is
safe to predict that it will not be long before
rare and valuable books will be as generally
sought for here as they are in France
and England, and become as well distributed
as are the choice treasures of the world
of art which find the highest competition in
the metropolis of the New World.</p>

<p class='c001'>Reviewing the book trade of the past
thirty years, a retrospect shows that year by
year the competition for rare and standard
books has become more keen and the older
ones necessarily more and more difficult to
procure. “In the English book-centers,”
says the reviewer, “besides a large home
demand, the purchases for the United States
and the English colonies keep up a steady
stream outward, and first editions must
sooner or later become unattainable, as they
will ultimately find a place in public institutions.”
Comparing the prices quoted in
early catalogues with those of to-day, for
instance, a copy of the Abbotsford edition
of Scott’s works, 17 vols., handsomely
whole-bound, priced twenty-five years
since at $125, is now priced at $225. The
Pickering Chaucer, then priced at $10, is
now held at $30. Major Walpole’s Anecdotes,
priced $22.50, is in the present catalogue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>at $75. Rowlandson’s Dance of
Death at $6.50 and the Dance of Life at
$1.75 have advanced to $75, for the three
volumes. In catalogue No. 2 a fine copy
of Purchas’s Pilgrims is quoted at $175. A
similar copy would now command $500.
In Catalogue No. 3 a fine copy of the Nuremberg
Chronicle is priced at $35; in the
present catalogue a copy is priced $150.
Based upon an experience of over thirty
years, the reviewer asserts that, however
fashion may change and this or that class
of books come into or pass out of vogue,
good sterling books of real merit will
always be in demand, while the first editions
of the works of great writers will
continue to rise steadily in value, and will
be prized as long as the English language is
spoken.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>La chasse aux bouquins</i> is not without
its disappointments and surprises. Time
and again one misses the mark, finally to
secure a rare prize. A captivating title is
not always a safe target. Appearances are
deceitful in book-titles, and the old book
catalogues have very winning ways. The
two bound volumes of Les Trois Mousquetaires,
which I picked up in a book-stall
along the quay at Paris years ago, contained
a pencil drawing of Porthos inserted
between the fly-leaf and title-page of Volume
I, worth a hundred times their cost.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Fortunately, they had escaped De Resbecq.
Whether Edouard Olin, the artist whose
name figures below, ever exhibited a picture
in the <i>Salon</i> subsequently, I do not
know. But his Porthos is a marvel of conception
and execution that would have delighted
Dumas and that would honor Détaille.</p>

<p class='c001'>A German catalogue was the means of
procuring me, at half the original cost of the
volume, a clean and perfect copy of Joseph
Boulmier’s Rimes Loyales. Paris: Poulet-Malassis
et De Brosse, 1857. The copy contains
on the false title the author’s <i>ex dono</i>
to Mademoiselle Andréa Bourgeois, and on
the reverse of the title-page, in the same
singularly neat handwriting, signed “J. B.,”
is a poem of six stanzas, scarcely exceeded
in beauty and finish by any from the pen
of the author of Rimes Loyales or Les Villanelles.
The lines are entitled Du Haut de
Montmartre, the first and sixth stanzas being
identical, and reading as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>L’aigle n’habite pas au fond de la vallée</div>
      <div class='line'>Il choisit pour son aire une cime isolée,</div>
      <div class='line'>Et c’est de là qu’il part, libre et capricieux.</div>
      <div class='line'>Le poète est semblable à l’aigle magnanime:</div>
      <div class='line'>Il aime les hauteurs où l’air vif le ranime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Où, plus loin de la terre, il est plus près des cieux.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>A friend and Tom Folio, who devours
the old book catalogues, saw this advertisement
a short time since in an English pamphlet:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Machiavelli (Nicolo). Opere, 11
vols., 4to, whole-bound russia extra, gilt
edges, with portrait, <i>printed throughout on
blue paper</i> (only eight copies so made), a
most superb set. Milan, 1810.... £4.”
He cabled for it and secured it. It proved
a blue diamond. Within a week after receiving
it he was offered two hundred dollars
for the work. Within a fortnight he
disposed of it for three hundred dollars, a
sufficient advance to make a large addition
to his library.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many tempting and deceptive titles occur
under the heading of “Curious” and
“Facetiæ,” but experience will cause one
to fight shy of catching titles and annotations
unless one knows the work to be
meritorious. Frequently the gold is in the
tooling, and the pure ore concealed beneath
an unattractive cover. Perhaps the windfalls
are more than offset by the disappointments.
Inviting volume after inviting volume
will present itself when one is not in
the humor, thrusting itself before you in the
book-stalls and auction sales, mutely appealing
to you to become its possessor, only
to elude you when you earnestly desire it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But auction sales are dangerous, and are
apt to lead to lapses and excesses that one
would not commit in calmer moments.
There it is difficult to decide dispassionately,
while the lots invariably bring far higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>prices than if obtained in the ordinary way.
Even those of stern judgment are led into
purchases they afterward regret, carried
away by the excitement of the moment.
The seductive voice of the auctioneer, the
passion for possession, the rivalry of the
bidders, and the excitement of the hour, all
exert their influence and combine to weaken
even the most stoical and wary. The fly
is placed temptingly upon the current, and
instantly it is seized.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, you dive into the foreign book
pamphlets, where a coveted treasure is
catalogued, almost inevitably upon application
to find it “sold,” the prize is so far
out of reach. But how elated you are
when you do secure a long-sought prize,
and after repeated attempts a tall old copy
in perfect condition and in lovely first letterpress
rewards your endeavors!</p>

<p class='c001'>Sainte-Beuve speaks of “the smiling and
sensible grace of Charles Lamb.” I am
inclined to think the latter’s characteristic
good humor was in part due to the facility
with which he procured the rare old editions
he loved. They were easier to lift
from the shelves in Lamb’s days than now,
and the old book-dealer possessed far less
“Imperfect Sympathies” than the hardened
modern Autolycus.</p>

<p class='c001'>My interpretation of Montaigne by Florio,
“thick folio, large copy, old calf, neat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>scarce, 1632,” and its predecessor of 1613
that lend such dignity to their companions
in old calf, were not obtained without persistent
efforts. Sometimes I think many
of my old books are not unlike Sir Roger
de Coverley’s fox, whose brush cost him
fifteen hours’ riding, carried him through
half a dozen counties, killed him a brace of
geldings, and lost above half his dogs. But
one’s rare editions need no brass nails to
record their bewitching title-pages or mark
their place amid the vistas of the shelves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Preferable to the editions of 1613 and
1603 is the later edition, the former lacking
the index, though containing the fine portrait
of the translator by Hole. Florio’s
strong and masterly English has well reflected
the original. I regard his translation
as far superior to the more generally accepted
version by Cotton. Cotton is frequently
more literal; but Florio, despite not unfrequent
interpolations and slight departures,
comes nearer to the coloring and picturesqueness
of the text. Take the spirited
passage of the hare and the harrier, for instance:</p>

<p class='c032'>Ce liéure qu’ vn leurier imagine en songe: apres
lequel nous le voyons haleter en dormant, allonger la
queuë, secoüer les jarrets, &amp; representer parfaitement les
mouuemens de sa course: c’est vn liéure sans poil &amp;
sans os.—Book II, chap. xii.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c034'>The <i>Hare</i> that a <i>Grey-Hound</i> imagines in his sleep,
after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>out his Tail, shake his Legs, and perfectly represent all
the motions of a Course, is a <i>Hare</i> without Furr and
without Bones.—Cotton’s translation.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c034'>That Hare, which a grey-hound imagineth in his
dreame, after whom as he sleepeth we see him bay,
quest, yelp, and snort, stretch out his taile, shake his
legs, and perfectly represent the motions of his course;
the same is a Hare without bones, without haire.—Florio’s
translation.</p>

<p class='c025'>Equally well rendered, and an excellent
specimen of the translator’s style, is the
passage of Volumnius referring to the election
of certain Roman citizens as consuls:
“They are men borne unto warre, of high
spirits, of great performance, and able to
effect anything; but rude, simple, and unarted
in the combat of talking; minds truly
consulare. They only are good Pretors, to
do justice in the Citie that are subtile, cautelous,
well-spoken, wily, and lip-wise.”
Florid and redundant, Florio nevertheless
employed his words as Walton did his frog;
and in numerous passages he out-Montaignes
Montaigne, his vocabulary, as Montaigne
says of the Italian cook’s, being
“stuffed with rich, magnificent words and
well-couched phrases; yea, such as learned
men use and employ in speaking of the
Government of an Empire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Speaking of Florio’s rendition, the sonnet
Concerning the Honour of Bookes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Since honour from the honorer proceeds,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>etc.—is well known. Not so familiar,
however, the preceding lines, likewise prefixed
to the editions of 1613 and 1632, and
relating equally to books. The sonnet,
which has no name attached and which
was naturally attributed to the translator,
is now generally thought by critics to be
by his friend Daniel, “of whom it is abundantly
worthy, and, indeed, most characteristic
in sentiment and diction,” observes
David Main. The somewhat extended
eulogium of author and translator is worth
transcribing for those who may not be
familiar with it. It corroborates, withal, a
view regarding the increasing multitude of
books, a multitude increased a thousand-fold
since Daniel’s time, that I have previously
touched upon. Relating as it does to the
French philosopher, it may well be diffusive.</p>
<p class='c001'>But no extended transcription of an old
author can stand out upon a modern page
with the vividness it does in a well-preserved
old edition. Apart from the charm
of antiquity, the old edition has an added
virtue which the new edition lacks—the
odor that clings to a venerable tome, a
fragrance as of the everlasting or <i>immortelle</i>
of the autumn fields, lingering amid its
ancient leaves. Nor is this altogether fancy;
the faded pages recall the ashen hue of the
flower, and like it they survive to preach
the sermon of immortality.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Daniel’s lines are thus inscribed: “To
my deare brother and friend M. John Florio,
one of the Gentlemen of her Majesties most
Royall Privie Chamber”:</p>

I HAVE two chairs for my reading—a
stiff one for books I <i>have</i> to
read; a luxurious one for books
I like to read. My luxurious
chair is of dark-green leather, a
seat to sink into, modeled after the easy
arm-chair of the Eversley Rectory, known
from its seductive properties as “Sleepy
Hollow.” When I find a volume more
than usually delightsome, I call in an extra
chair for a foot-rest, so the body may possess
the same ease as the mind. And yet
the delight a volume affords depends largely
upon the mood in which the leaves are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>turned, and the printer who has turned the
leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>A fondness for reading the old book
catalogues is apt to prove not only an expensive
luxury, but consumes a great deal
of time. For no catalogue may be hastily
skimmed through. The least attractive list,
composed largely, it may be, of works on
theology, mineralogy, theosophy, or jurisprudence,
may contain the precise book you
are searching for. The most attractive lists
must naturally be perused carefully. In
fact, reading catalogues is like reading
books—even with attentive reading one
is liable to skip a title, or, at least, overlook
its real significance, just as one may not always
grasp the true meanings of an author
upon first perusal. Then, one subject or
one title leads to another, and the catalogue
must be reread. Even when you have made
out your list, it occurs to you that half or
three quarters of the lot you have selected
will undoubtedly be “sold”; and having
left out a number you really desire, you go
over the catalogue still more carefully a
third time for “substitutes.” Not only
this, but the catalogue differs from a book
in that it can not wait or be put off. It
must be studied immediately it is received;
or some one else gets the advantage, as
some one else living nearer by generally does.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the business you have on hand prevents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>your devoting the necessary time to
the catalogue or catalogues, you are haunted
with the feeling that it contains a prize, and
that you may not catch the first mail. Indeed,
should any of the lists contain, at
anything like a reasonable figure, that scarce
old Herbal, an ancient angling tome, or a
certain edition of Les Caractères, which you
have long been searching for, you ought to
telegraph for it without a moment’s delay.
You know Smith will read his list the minute
he receives it. He is already far richer
in La Bruyères than you are, and never
ceases collecting them. And although he
already has the edition you desire, it is ten
to one if he sees it offered at a bargain in fine
antique binding he will duplicate it. There
is no such contingency as his skipping it.
He never skips—he secures and exults.
His library shelves groan with La Bruyères.
Were he rich he might be forgiven; but all
his prizes have been hooked by careful
angling, and are a triumph to his skill and
monumental industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charles Asselineau, in the unique little
volume L’Enfer du Bibliophile, draws a
sharp line between the true book-hunter,
who makes use of his own knowledge,
patience, and industry, and the hunter by
proxy, who bags his spoils through cunning
other than his own-“the rich and
lazy amateur who only hunts by procuration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>and trusts to the care of an accomplished
professional to whom he gives <i>carte
blanche</i>, and who despises him—ay, who
despises him, as the game-keeper and
poacher always despise the indolent and
unskillful master who triumphs through
their skill.” The opening sentence of the
volume is worthy of Sterne: “<i>Oui ...
l’enfer!</i> is it not there that one must arrive
sooner or later, in this life or in the other;
oh all of you who have placed your joys in
voluptuousness unknown to the vulgar?”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, you have the alternative
of neglecting your business and attending
to the catalogues. In any case, the
book catalogue is an attraction and a bane.
If you are niggardly and only order a volume
or two, you are generally disappointed;
if you are in a liberal mood, and order a
number, thinking you will only obtain a few,
you are likely to get a lot of books that will
deprive you of getting others you really
require. Then the works one continually
sees that one can not afford, the columns
of temptations all crying, “Farewell! thou
art too dear for my possessing”—the Paris
catalogues in particular, so rich in their
<i>embarras de richesses</i>. There is a stanza
of Clough’s that may be cited as pertinent
to book-hunting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They may talk as they please about what they call pelf,</div>
      <div class='line'>And how one ought never to think of one’s self,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>How pleasures of thought surpass eating and drinking,</div>
      <div class='line'>My pleasure of thought is the pleasure of thinking</div>
      <div class='line in6'>How pleasant it is to have money, heigh-ho!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>How pleasant it is to have money!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Possibly the old book catalogues are sent
as a lesson in self-control, and to teach one
to endure disappointment as patiently as
human nature will allow.</p>
<p class='c001'>Not the least interesting volume of my
library is my herbarium. Still every pressed
flower retains much of its original color, reviving
the scene of many a pleasant ramble.
Commencing with the first cluster of spring
beauty and white shad-blow spray, and
ending with the last purple aster and blue
gentian of autumn, it is thus a sentient
floral calendar—a fragrant anthology of the
seasons. It is one of my pleasantest volumes
for winter reading, every flower of
which is a chapter written by Nature herself.
This involucre of white dogwood,
for instance, becomes a vernal landscape
riotous with bloom, while these feathery
mespilus blossoms bring up the April hillsides
sprinkled with hepaticas and violets.
This bunch of trilliums recalls a distant
beechwood in early May carpeted with the
snowy triangular flowers and misty with
the beech’s unfurling leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this pink lady’s-slipper!</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more I trace the sinuous curves of
the Wiscoy and am lulled by the drowsy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>murmur of the stream. How cool the
water swirls beneath the overarching hemlocks,
and how it is churned into foam in
the deep, dark pool at the tail of the rapid,
where I know the big trout I hooked and
lost the previous year is waiting for another
taste of my “cochybondu”! It is just at
the base of the steep shaded hillside where
the sun never penetrates. If my trout
chooses to display his rubies and chrysoberyls
he must thread his way up the current
or float down to the meadow far below.
When I have hooked and basketed
him, another big fellow will occupy his
place in the same deep, dark pool.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the choice spot of the stream within
a reach of half a mile, and invariably holds
the strongest fish and most accomplished
taker of <i>ephemeræ</i>. His pannier must needs
be large, so many flies and midges and
worms and bugs and beetles drift past his
lair, and are sucked in by the eddy into his
awaiting maw. The sudden dive of a water-rat
proclaims a rival angler, who may
also have his eye on my trout, and bring
him to bag, perchance, if I miss him to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>An aroma of mint, mingled with the
fragrance of wild flowers and ferns, follows
me along the banks; and there, in the
swamp where the partridge drums, my
pink lady’s-slipper gleams. The twisting
roots of the hemlock plunge deep into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>pool; and with a slap of his red tail the big
trout rises just beyond them in the foam-flecks
of the eddy, precisely where he rose
the previous year. How the water growls
round the bank it has mined, and chafes
and scolds at the obtruding prongs! And
how picturesquely, too, the old hemlock
leans over the stream, shading the trout for
the last time! Another athlete and trained
fly-catcher must lead the somersault acts
hereafter; for a day at least the small fry
may rest secure. But, alas! with a sudden
rush, my trout has wound the leader fast
around the hemlock’s roots, as he has
wound so many leaders before; and, with
a farewell flash of his encarmined sides, I
seem to hear his parting message: “<i>Multæ
lapsæ inter truttam et bascaudem sunt!</i>”
The pressed flower remains to remind me
of the struggle and my June holiday.</p>

<p class='c001'>Looking now at the pink lady’s-slipper
from the Wiscoy woods, I am glad, after
all, I did not take my trout, however great
a triumph his capture might have afforded
me at the time. For, if the water-rat has
not caught him meanwhile—and the maxim
the trout flung at me virtually precludes this
possibility—he is undoubtedly still swimming
in his favorite pool. Granting I had
caught him and that a fish of equal size had
taken his place, it would yet be another
trout, not <i>my</i> trout which I hooked and lost.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The stream flows more musically and more
limpid to me knowing he is still stemming
the current, and that he regained his freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>This spike of cardinal flowers carries me
a hundred miles away; and once more am I
drifting down the Oswego River on a hazy
autumnal afternoon, indifferent whether the
great green bass rise or not, so golden is
the September day. It is enough to be
idling beneath the roar of the rapid, to mark
the different hues of the water, the play of
the slanting sunbeams, the undulations of
the wooded shores. Surely the landscape
needs no more. Ah, yes! just that bit of
color skirting a still bayou, the flame of
cardinal flowers and their reflected images
below. What an illustrated volume! the
imperial folio of the seasons! And what a
succession of illuminated pages it discloses
from the rubric and the preface until the last
leaf is turned! every subject indexed and
paged by the grand author, Nature; its types
as fresh as if they had only run through one,
instead of thousands of editions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In dreams do I behold in all the great
libraries the procession of the books that
nightly emerge from the seclusion of their
shelves—countless flowers from the Muse’s
hill and garlands from the meadows of the
classics. At a signal from the most antiquated
tome, I see a sudden movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>among their ranks, and hear a rustling of
innumerable leaves, as the souls of the immortals
are quickened into life, and the
spirits of old authors assemble for converse.
Platoons of majestic folios, some in calf,
some in sheep, and some in stamped pigskin
appear, columns of venerable and vellumed
quartos, tiers of tall octavos, troops
of lovely Elzevirs, Aldines, and sedate black-letter
editions file by with measured tread.
Volumes black with age move with step as
elastic as those clothed in more modern
garb. Indeed, old and young seem to be
indiscriminately mingled, without regard
to costume or richness of attire. Only, I
observe that the procession is composed
solely of the dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>I notice, moreover, that it is only the
books of real merit or great renown that
are called to take part in the pageant; and
that the participants vary with each succeeding
night, appearing entirely without
regard to chronological order, though all
the beautiful world of <i>belles-lettres</i>, philosophy,
and science that has charmed and
instructed mankind throughout the ages,
forms the processional. Thus a copy of
Plato and a first folio of Shakespeare pass
by, side by side, followed by The Canterbury
Tales and the Faerie Queen, hand in
hand. Or is it Goethe’s Faust and Plutarch’s
Lives? It is sometimes difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>catch the titles, so numerous are the volumes
that take part. As the eye becomes
accustomed to the dimness, the titles are
more easily traced, and I distinctly recognize
Horace and Virgil, Milton and Keats,
Herrick and Hood, Montaigne and Pascal,
Lamb, Thackeray, Cervantes, Molière, Theocritus,
Dante, Schiller, Balzac, Dumas the
Elder, Pope, Burns, Goldsmith, Addison,
Hawthorne, Bulwer, Dickens, Irving—until
the eye is dazed at the multitudinous names.
Night after night the procession forms and
the participants vary—there are so many
volumes to take part, so many that may
not be overlooked. Richard Jefferies, his
beautiful thoughts scarcely dry on the page,
I note has just been called forth from the
shelves, and Thoreau has already marched
with Walton and Gilbert White.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although not assisting in the pageant
itself, there are, I perceive, numerous volumes
that, nevertheless, appear to be in
communication with such of their companions
as have responded to the signal. Beckoning
glances from those below are answered
every now and then by faint
responses from the volumes above, their
leaves as yet unfoxed by Time. Of these
latter there are many, and I soon perceive
that they bear the names of living authors
of note who must wait until their earthly
life is spent ere they too may answer the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>roll-call and take rank with the immortals.
How, apparently without volition of their
own, as if touched by an unseen hand, the
leaves of In Memoriam rustle and the pages
of The Autocrat flutter!</p>

<p class='c001'>The only participants I see that seem to
be out of place assemble once a year in
solemn conclave, conversing, it is true, but
wearing a dejected look. Countless volumes,
these, principally first and rare editions,
many bound in lovely leathers, exquisitely
gilded, lettered, and tooled, bearing
innumerable stamps and monograms,
coats-of-arms, and ancient book-plates.
Many of them I recognize as having seen
before in high spirits, discoursing with their
companions during the hour of the nightly
pageants. This yearly and unusually large
gathering, characterized by its extreme gravity,
puzzled me at first, until I discovered it
was composed of the ghosts of borrowed
books, unhappy in their covers, lamenting
the loss of their former possessors who had
once cherished them so fondly. I see,
too, Boccaccio’s Il Decamerone, Brantôme’s
Dames Galantes, Balzac’s Physiologie du
Mariage, La Fontaine’s Contes with the
Eisen, De Hooge, and Fragonard plates, and
in yonder soiled, foul-smelling tome I perceive
the smutty old satirist and Doctor-Franciscan
Rabelais. Why he should be
called out at all, seems a mystery, his pitch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>is so defiling, and his boluses are so nauseating.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some participants there are which at
first baffled my comprehension. These,
though perfectly composed themselves and
mingling freely with their fellows, nevertheless
appear to excite an inordinate curiosity
among their companions which is
never gratified. The titles they bear are
plainly discernible; but only when the
march becomes sufficiently animated to
cause a violent fluttering of the leaves can I
catch a glimpse of the author’s name on the
title-page. Then I discover these numerous
tomes invariably reveal the name of a
most voluminous and versatile author, whose
personality it is impossible to fathom, an
author writing with equal facility in all languages
and on all topics, in poetry and in
prose, persistently preserving his <i>incognito</i>
under the name of “Anon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I see, also, participating in the pageant
semi-annually, and on these occasions directing,
as it were, the imposing march of
the volumes, numerous men of middle and
advanced age that seem to exhale an odor
of musty tomes. Occasionally these pause
in their march before some one of the shelves
to take down a volume which I have not
before seen in the procession, handling it
with reverential care, as if conscious of the
gems it enshrined. Sometimes it is a volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>by a living author of note; again it is
an encyclopædia or concordance, or a special
number of some dusty periodical that has
long lain unopened. On inquiry of my informant,
I learned that this human element
consists of the painstaking custodians who
had the volumes in keeping, the scholarly
and unappreciated librarians who devoted
so much labor to the cataloguing and classification
of their charges.</p>

<p class='c001'>Abruptly close the clasps of the most
venerable tome. Again I hear the rustling
of pages and folding of covers, as each
volume returns to its accustomed place
and once more sinks into hallowed slumber.
The librarian of one of the great libraries
where the nightly pageant forms scouted
the idea of his charges leaving their retreats.
“Would I not hear them?—besides the
dust remains undisturbed!” he replied.
But a dead author makes no noise and
leaves no tell-tale traces when he quits his
tenement of print. Books, so eminently
human, in the natural course of things must
have their ghosts. Of course, the librarian’s
candle would dissipate them, as mists
are dispersed by the sun.</p>

ONCE more the spring, the sunshine,
and the youth of the year.
As much of contentment, perhaps,
as the majority may find
within the confines of brick and
stone my house has yielded me throughout
the long months of winter. Grateful I am
for the comfort it has afforded—its warmth,
its luxury, its cheer. Yet ever with the return
of spring and the song of birds, the
house becomes merely secondary to the
grounds, the garden, and the charms of
external nature.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Again I lounge on the grass-plot overlooking
the river. Once more I watch the
sparkle of the water and inhale the scent
of the wild honeysuckle, sentient with the
sweet breath of the summer. The bees
hum, the wood-dove calls, the soothing
roar of the rapids rises and falls. Again,
through the morning haze, I note the
pleasure craft idling on the breast of the
river; while yonder, her painted canvas
unfurled, a strange craft is slowly rounding
a curve of the shore.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did I say my ship had come? Alas!
the wood-dove only murmured in his
dream, and my ship sailed past to deposit
her precious stores at the harbor of my
more fortunate neighbor.</p>

castles in Spain that we are always building—and

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
